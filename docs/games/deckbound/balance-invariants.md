# Deckbound — Balance Invariants

## BI-1 — Role diversity dominates monotony 🟡

**Invariant.** At party size = the number of roles, the party with **one of each role** has a
**strictly better outcome** than **every** same-size party made of a **single repeated role**.
Strictly better = it clears content the mono party cannot, or clears the objective in **fewer
Days** (better par). Formally, for the all-distinct party `D` and each mono party `Mᵣ` (role `r`
repeated to fill the party), `D` beats `Mᵣ` in the `(clears?, −Days)` ordering, for every `r`.

**Why.** This is the teeth of Charter **#4** (asymmetry by design; coverage comes from the **team**,
not an evened-out roster) and **#8.5** (the five roles are the §4 triangle's splits — a balanced
team answers gates a mono team can't). It is the role-level instance of the §6 rule **interesting
(diverse) beats boring (mono)**: a single-role party is a degenerate composition that *should* be
dominated, by design — not a viable line we accidentally left on the table.

**Check.** **Partially evidenced today:** the reference scenario's final gate is tuned to **require
the full roster** — a mono party fails it while the specialist roster clears it
([`reference.rs::check_combat_bands`](../../../crates/deckbound/src/reference.rs)). **Full
verification** — that the diverse party beats *every* mono party in `(clears?, −Days)` across the
whole run — is **pending the par solver** (§0.3).

**Scope & notes.** Anchored to the reference scenario (the balance instrument); it should generalise
to any scenario authored to demand coverage. It compares the **all-distinct vs all-same** endpoints;
the partial-diversity spectrum in between (e.g. 3 distinct + 2 repeats) is the subject of future
invariants. It does **not** claim diversity is *strictly* best among *interesting* builds — only
that it dominates monotony; parity *among* diverse strategies is the separate §6 target.

## BI-2 — Solo viability is ordered, and inverse to synergy ⬜

**Invariant.** The single-role ("mono") parties are ranked by outcome in a fixed **solo-friendliness
order** — **Wall ≥ Artillery ≥ Infiltrator ≥ Controller ≥ Support** — and the one-of-each-role party
beats every one of them. Formally, on the reference scenario, in the `(clears?, −Days)` ordering:
`outcome(mono-Wall) ≥ outcome(mono-Artillery) ≥ outcome(mono-Infiltrator) ≥ outcome(mono-Controller)
≥ outcome(mono-Support)`, and `outcome(all-distinct) >` each. This is the **ordered sharpening of
BI-1** (which only asserts the last clause).

**Why.** The operational form of Charter **#4** (roles unbalanced *by design*; balance is in the
team). Solo viability tracks **how much of a role's kit fires without allies**: Wall is self-contained
(hold + sustain), the glass cannons (Artillery, then Infiltrator — whose slip-keyed kit is almost
entirely *relational*) work alone but fragile, and the effect roles produce *modifiers* with no base
of their own — Support is **Might-0 / attack Neither**, pure amplification. Crucially this order is
**inverse to synergy**: the role weakest alone (Support) is the strongest *multiplier*, which is
precisely *why* a team exceeds its parts (Spec §8.5's `3 + 2`). Pinning the order keeps each role's
identity — "doomed alone, devastating combined" for Support/Controller — intact under tuning, and is
the role-level engine of the depth/breadth fork (#2).

**Check.** **Pending the par solver** — it is an ordering over six parties (five mono + the diverse
one) on the reference scenario. Today: directionally consistent with
[`reference.rs::check_combat_bands`](../../../crates/deckbound/src/reference.rs) (the objective needs
the full roster; a clean-slate "bare" character loses its gate). The **inverse-synergy** half — that
Support contributes the *most* as a team complement and Wall the *least* — is measurable as **marginal
team contribution** once the solver exists; until then it is the stated rationale, not a hard check.

**Scope & notes.** The **relative order** is the designer's stated gradient and the firm claim; the
**margins** are tuned, not fixed, so adjacent ties are allowed (`≥`, not `>`). Only monotonicity and
the endpoints are asserted (Wall = best mono, Support = worst mono, diverse beats all). **Subsumes
BI-1.** Anchored to the reference scenario; generalises to any coverage-demanding scenario.

## BI-3 — Force, not fiat (no rule forbids what stats can buy) ✅

**Invariant.** A single character with **no role cards / powers** but **arbitrarily large stats**
(Speed, Daring, Might, Vitality) **wins any finite-stat encounter in one round.** Equivalently: for every
rank it could take and every defending formation of finite stats, enough Speed / Daring / Might / Vitality
lets the lone god **reach and kill every enemy within round 1**.

**Why.** The operational form of the §4 (`canon/2-spec/README.md`) **"force, not fiat"** guarantee, and
of Charter **#12** (*outpaced, not forbidden*): opposition must always be **cost**, never
**impossibility**. A failure means some rule **forbids by fiat** — a hard cap (e.g. one strike per
unit), an immunity, a **skill-gate** (an outcome reachable only with a specific power), or a
**permanently-unreachable rank**. The **no-powers** clause forces the win to come from *stats*, so no
skill can be a load-bearing *key*; the **infinite-stats** clause isolates rule-barriers from tuning. It
complements **BI-1**: BI-1 says a same-treasure balanced party matches or beats a god; BI-3 says raw
force, given enough of it, is never *walled off* — together they pin "power scales with treasure, by
force, with no hard floor or ceiling by fiat."

**Check.** ✅ **Wired** —
[`balance.rs::bi3_force_not_fiat_infinite_god_wipes_any_finite_party_in_one_round`](../../../crates/deckbound/src/balance.rs):
a god with **large-but-finite** stats (`1_000_000`, to avoid overflow) and **no role cards** must win
under a **one-round `Ruleset`** (so "wins" *is* "round-1 wipe") against adversarial finite formations —
a deep wall (Brutes), a swarm (Husks), and a hide-in-the-back line (Seers). It runs against the
static-ranks resolver of record. *(Wiring it surfaced and fixed a real fiat-ish gap: the solver only
flanked units with an Infiltrator card, so a no-skills high-Daring god was stuck as a one-clash-per-round
Vanguard; `wants_flank` now also fires on raw Daring — stats alone make a flanker.)*

**Scope & notes.** Uses a large *finite* value, not literal infinity (overflow safety + a terminating
"act while you have Tempo" loop). The **round-1** bar is the sharp form — overwhelming force, not merely
sufficient-over-many-rounds. It is the guard behind §4's *"every rank is reachable by enough force / no
permanent safe rank,"* and it is **not** a claim about balanced play — only that the rules never make an
outcome *impossible* where stats should make it *costly-but-achievable*.

## Adding an invariant

Copy the BI-1 shape: **Invariant** (precise enough to check), **Why** (the Charter north star /
Spec section it serves, and which §6 case — "interesting beats boring" or "interesting on par" — it
instances), **Check** (how it is or will be verified, honestly stating what's pending), and
**Scope & notes**. Give it the next `BI-N` id. When the par solver lands, each invariant should
become an assertion it runs, so a retune that breaks one fails the build (computability-and-balance.md
§4).
