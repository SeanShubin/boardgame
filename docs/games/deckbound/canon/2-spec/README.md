# Deckbound — Mechanical Spec

**Canonical for mechanics.** This is the precise statement of how Deckbound's
systems work. It is a source of truth (see
[`0-source-of-truth.md`](../0-source-of-truth.md)) — the code conforms to it, not the
other way around. It owns **vocabulary and procedures**, not **numbers** (numbers
live in [`booklet.ron`](../../../../crates/deckbound/data/booklet.ron)).

## How to read a rule

Every rule is a triple. This format is mandatory — it is what makes the
intent-vs-mechanics distinction answerable.

- **RULE** — what the mechanic *is*, stated precisely and operationally. The thing
  the code must implement and the manual must print.
- **WHY** — the intent: the problem it solves and the Charter north star it serves.
  Changing this is changing **design intent** — a human decision.
- **GUARANTEES** — the invariants the rule exists to preserve. A change that keeps
  the RULE's letter but breaks a GUARANTEE is a defect even if it "compiles."

The point of the **WHY** is **motivation**: a rule whose form follows from its intent
is *re-derivable* — a reader who forgets the letter can reconstruct it from the WHY.
That is this Spec's aim, **conceptual integrity**: every rule springs from a few
intents, so you *reconstruct* the mechanics rather than memorize them. So **prefer a
motivated rule — one that carries its own rationale — over a merely short one**, and
treat a rule you cannot motivate as a smell. This is **Charter north star #10
(conceptual integrity)**; theme is one engine of motivation (a rule that falls out of
the fiction is re-derivable from the world), but a rule can equally be motivated by its
consequence. See also [`0-source-of-truth.md`](../0-source-of-truth.md) — "Motivated rules."

Numbers appear only as *(appendix)* illustrations; the real values are in
`booklet.ron` and are human-tuned.

**Keyword rules** additionally carry a **MANUAL** line — the one sentence that
prints in the rulebook / on hover. The engine pairs each keyword's handler with
this line so digital and printed rules can't drift; the Spec is where that line is
authored.

**Cards may supersede the core.** Every rule here is a **default**. A card may
**explicitly override** a specific core rule — and it says so on its face, naming the
rule it bends. This keeps the core small and learnable while letting variety live on the
cards (e.g. the core says melee Actors fight only from the front, §4.2; a card can grant a ranged
front-liner). A card never *silently* contradicts the core; an unstated conflict is a defect.

## 0. The deterministic core — separable balance 🟡

Deckbound is built so that **balance is decomposable.** Beneath the played game sits a
**deterministic, perfect-information, single-agent core** — the canonical mode with the Clash
module **off** and creature draw decks and locations **open**. That core is **feasibly
computable**: a scenario's par (fewest Days to clear it) and every combat outcome can be
*computed*, not estimated. **Luck and hidden information are separable layers on top of it.** The
design contract: **solve the core, balance each luck layer in isolation, and the composition is
balanced with high confidence** — without ever solving the full stochastic game. This section is
the binding form of that contract; full rationale, the design-review checklist, and the balancing
method are in [`computability-and-balance.md`](../../computability-and-balance.md) (**Charter
#11**). *(This is the **whole-game** core for tuning; not to be confused with the **Clash**, the
**tactical** core of §1.)*

> **Game-theoretic placement (the general theory is in [`docs/game-theory/`](../../../../game-theory/README.md)).**
> Deckbound deliberately occupies the *easy* cells of the game-theory map, and reserves the hard ones for
> optional modes. The general concepts live in the game-theory directory; here is how each maps to this
> Spec:
> - **Single-agent planning, not a game** — PvE foes run a fixed policy, so "optimal play" is a *plan*
>   (`∃ a winning sequence`), not a minimax equilibrium ([`game-classification.md`](../../../../game-theory/game-classification.md)). This is §0.1.
> - **Exact bounded solving** — reachability (luck-off) and expectimax over fixed creature distributions
>   (luck-on), via backward induction over the bounded horizon
>   ([`solution-concepts.md`](../../../../game-theory/solution-concepts.md)). This is §0.4 (the analysis
>   envelope) and `computability-and-balance.md` §10.7 (the battle solver).
> - **Counter systems** — the Clash (§1.0) and the Aggressor ▸ Glass-Cannon ▸ Turtle playstyle RPS (§4)
>   are counter systems; balance them against the counter-system hierarchy
>   ([`hierarchy-of-concerns.md`](../../../../game-theory/hierarchy-of-concerns.md),
>   [`measurement-mechanics.md`](../../../../game-theory/measurement-mechanics.md)).
> - **Mixed strategies live only in the hidden-simultaneous layer** — the per-round **blind bid** (§4)
>   and the optional Clash are the only places randomization (and a *value of unpredictability*) matters;
>   the open PvE skeleton stays a pure **maximizer** (`solution-concepts.md` §4; the fidelity rule is
>   `computability-and-balance.md` §5.1). True minimax/mixed-Nash hardness returns only in **Versus**
>   (§3.4), quarantined out of the core.
> - **Cooperative value** — "does each role pull its weight" is a marginal-contribution / Shapley

>   ([`cooperative-and-marginal-value.md`](../../../../game-theory/cooperative-and-marginal-value.md);
>   `computability-and-balance.md` §10).

### 0.1 The core is computable

**RULE.** With the **Clash module off** and creature decks and locations **open**, the game is
**deterministic** (no rule consumes randomness), **perfect-information** (nothing hidden),
**single-agent** in PvE (creatures run a fixed, non-adaptive policy — an environment, not an
opponent that searches back), and **bounded** (a Day cap, finitely many reachable builds,
terminating combat). A run is therefore a finite planning problem with a computable optimum, whose
state is **`(positions, cleared-set, builds, Day)`** — and the **builds** are the campaign's *only*
carried state: combat is stateless, but **progression** is not.

**WHY.** A computable core is the **balance instrument**: it lets us *prove* a scenario is
beatable, *compute* its par, and *check* that no single line dominates (#11). It is how we **keep**
#2's "no solvable collapse" and #4's "balance by scenario" — by *measuring* them instead of hoping.
Lose computability and balance becomes unverifiable.

**GUARANTEES.**
- **Clash off ⇒ a battle's outcome is a pure function** of the two sides' Forms and the encounter —
  no RNG, bit-identical every run.
- Creatures never **adapt to the player's specific plan** (fixed instinct / policy); PvE stays
  single-agent. *(Two human sides is the Versus mode, §3.4 — outside the core.)*
- A battle carries **no _combat_ state between fights** — each is rebuilt from `(build, place)`, so
  no wounds or buffs persist; combat is therefore a **memoizable oracle** over the finite set of
  reachable builds. The campaign's carried state is the **build** (progression, §8.5) plus the
  economy that funds it (§8.3) — *not* combat history.
- **No path-dependent budget.** The build's resource / ownership state must be a function of *what*
  you have, never *how you got it*. Owned assets only **accrue** (monotone), **combine additively and
  order-independently** (§5.2 / §2.3 — commutative Form), and **no operation refunds a spent
  resource** (no sell-back, no consume-then-recover). **This is what keeps progression computable:**
  characters evolve along *many trajectories*, but order-independence collapses them onto a *small set
  of build states*, and monotonicity makes dominance pruning valid (an earlier or superset build
  dominates) — so trajectory-diversity does **not** become state-explosion. **The killer is a
  path-dependent budget, not movement:** freely *rearranging already-owned, monotone assets* (e.g.
  reassigning a card between characters) keeps the build Markovian and is fine; it is **resource
  refund / oscillation, order-dependent stacking, or multiplicative combos** that make the budget
  history-dependent and explode the search. *(This is the precise form of the old "no removal/swap"
  shorthand — sharpened 2026-06-19.)*
- The run is **bounded and terminating** — Days are capped, branching is finite, combat has its
  termination backstop (§1.6).

### 0.2 Luck is a separable layer

**RULE.** Every **randomness or hidden-information** mechanism — the Clash's hidden simultaneous
reveal and randomized creature decks (§1), location fog (§8.1), the event deck (§8.2), threat-deck
draws (§8.4) — is an **optional layer over the core.** Disabling all of them **recovers the
computable core unchanged.** No luck mechanism is load-bearing for core *function*: turning luck off
may make the game easier or more legible, but never breaks it.

**WHY.** Separability is what makes balance decompose (#11): if luck lifts off cleanly, the core can
be solved on its own and each luck layer reasoned about on its own. A luck mechanism welded into
core function would couple the two and destroy the instrument.

**GUARANTEES.**
- There is a switch (conceptual or real) that disables each luck / hidden-info mechanism; with all of
  them off, the game is exactly the §0.1 core.
- No core rule's **correctness** depends on a luck mechanism being present — only its *difficulty* or
  *legibility* may.

### 0.3 Separable balance

**RULE.** Balance is established in two **independent** steps and composed. **(1) The core is
balanced on the solver:** par is computed and the numbers tuned so that *many* **interesting**
strategies tie near par and **no** strategy dominates them — including the **closure check** that no
*unnamed* strategy beats the interesting set. **(2) Each luck layer is balanced in isolation:** shown
neutral / non-dominant on its own terms **before** it is added. A luck layer is not admitted until it
is independently balanced.

**WHY.** If the core is balanced and only **independently-balanced** luck is added, the full
(non-computable) game is balanced with high confidence — without solving the full game (#11). The
player still meets uncomputable strategy (#2) and scenario-borne fairness (#4); the *designer* gets an
objective floor.

**GUARANTEES.**
- Core balance is **objective** — measured against the computed par, not estimated by playtest alone.
  *(Today the harness is the reference scenario's invariant / combat-band checks —
  `reference-scenario.md`; the full par solver is a pending build — see `computability-and-balance.md`
  §4, §8.)*
- No luck mechanism ships **un-balanced on its own** (neutral-in-expectation / no dominant exploit in
  isolation); "balance the whole stochastic game directly" is **never** the method.
- **Par is policy-relative** — always stated relative to a fixed combat resolver; a weak resolver
  biases the result (`computability-and-balance.md` §5).

*(SEEDED — §0 graduates Charter #11 into binding GUARANTEES. §0.1 / §0.2 are structural invariants
the code already upholds (Clash is the sole RNG; battles rebuild from `(build, place)`; Form
combination is commutative, §5.5). §0.3 is the **method**: its instrument — the par solver / balance
harness — is a pending build (a Rust crate or `examples/` program, never an ad-hoc script), so today
core balance leans on the reference-scenario checks. No `TERM` encyclopedia lines: these are
**designer** invariants, not player vocabulary.)*

**RULE.** Two of combat's bounds are **pre-game parameters**, not fixed laws — set once before a battle
like the seed and the Clash module, and carried in the **`Ruleset`** (`ruleset.rs`):
- a **round cap** — reaching it ends the fight as a **draw** (in PvE, a draw is no different from a
  loss given current mechanics); and
- a **roster cap** — the max distinct unit *types* per side, where a **swarm counts as one** (identical
  instances are symmetric).

Live play uses `Ruleset::default()` (effectively unbounded — the historical termination backstop, §1.6
/ §4). **Analysis tooling uses `Ruleset::analysis()`** (a short horizon — currently 5 rounds — and a
small roster — 5 types). The bounded envelope is what makes optimal single-combat play **finite and
exactly searchable**: with a hard round horizon whose leaf is *terminal by rule*, there is nothing to
estimate — backward induction is exact, with **no evaluation heuristic** (the usual source of
"strong-but-not-perfect"). The roster cap (with swarm-as-one symmetry) bounds per-round branching.

**WHY.** §0.1 says the core is computable *in principle*; this is the lever that makes it computable *in
practice*. The horizon collapses depth and removes the convergence/backstop reasoning; the draw-on-cap
rule makes the PvE objective a clean boolean ("winnable within the horizon?"), so a perfect player is a
bounded reachability search rather than an open-ended optimizer. In the game-theoretic modes (PvP,
Clash, a simultaneous auction) the same bounds shrink each hidden-simultaneous commit to a *small matrix
game* solvable by LP, so backward induction over the bounded horizon computes the equilibrium.

**GUARANTEES.**
- The round/roster bounds are **parameters**, defaulting to unbounded live play; only the *analysis*
  setup imposes the short envelope, so live balance/behaviour is unchanged by their existence.
- Bounding gives **finiteness / tractability**, which is **orthogonal to rule completeness**: the solver
  still optimizes a *concrete* rule-set, so the §4 open dials (the bid / free-hit magnitudes) must be
  pinned (or the static-ranks semantics ratified) before "perfect" means
  *perfect at the designed game*.
- The envelope doubles as a **design assertion**: every intended encounter is winnable within the
  horizon under optimal play; one that is not is **mis-tuned** (too grindy), not merely "hard". A
  not-enforced cap means a cap-draw verdict reads as "violates the round-horizon design target", not
  "the unbounded game cannot win it". *(Empirically the reference campaign resolves within **3** rounds
  under the greedy resolver — comfortably inside the 5-round envelope, so the bound is non-disruptive
  today.)*

*(SEEDED — no `TERM` lines: a **designer/analysis** invariant, not player vocabulary. The `Ruleset`
exists in code; the par-solver that consumes the envelope is the pending build of §0.3 /
`computability-and-balance.md`.)*

## 1. The Clash — *the tactical core* ✅

The atom of combat: two Actors **predicting each other** across a hidden, simultaneous
mix-up played with cards. Design background:
[`notes/the-duel.md`](../notes/the-duel.md).

> **History.** This section formerly specced a stance/Edge duel (Marshal · Unleash ·
> Overwhelm · Parry, tracked Edge) and then an interim six-move *charge* duel. Both are
> **superseded by §1.0 (The Clash)** below — the four-card, Force-stealing,
> **ends-on-strike** duel. The old stance/Edge subsections (§1.1–§1.5, §1.8) are kept for
> design history behind banners; their WHY/GUARANTEES carry forward. §1.3 (ends-on-strike)
> is **restored** as current; §1.6 is reworded for it; §3 (Tempo/Focus) is rewritten and
> §3.3 (Exposed) is removed.

> **The Clash is an optional module.** The canonical floor (§4.2) resolves a same-range
> engagement as a **simultaneous trade**; the Clash below *replaces* that trade with a four-card
> mix-up + Force when a scenario enables it. Everything in §3–§4 (roles, phases, positions,
> Tempo) runs identically either way.
>
> **Reconciliation pending (2026-06-20).** This section still uses the old **Focus / Mind** vocabulary
> (e.g. "reading the foe with Focus unlocks your stance menu"). Those are **merged/removed** — there is
> one **Tempo** pool now (§3.1), and the Clash is **off in the base game** (the campaign uses the §4.2
> trade). A full §1 reconciliation (re-expressing the Clash's read/commit layer in Tempo terms, or
> confirming the Clash keeps its own internal currency) is **deferred** — it is not on the
> base-combat code path. Where §1 conflicts with §2–§4, **§2–§4 win.**

### 1.0 The Clash — four cards, Force, ends-on-strike

**RULE.** A duel is a sequence of **beats**. Each beat both fighters **secretly choose one
card** and reveal **simultaneously** — no one reveals first; any "see their card before you
choose" effect is a special ability, never the core. The duel **ends the instant one or both
are struck**. The kit is four cards, always complete:

- **Strike** — hit *where they are now*. Beats **Gather**; stopped by **Evade**.
- **Anticipate** — hit *where they'll be* (lead the target). Beats **Evade**; stopped by
  **Gather**.
- **Gather** — *hold your ground* (a defense) **and build Force** (+1). Stops **Anticipate**;
  beaten by **Strike**.
- **Evade** — *move*. Stops **Strike**; beaten by **Anticipate**.

**The cycle.** Anticipate ▸ Evade ▸ Strike ▸ Gather ▸ Anticipate (each beats the next), plus
**Strike > Anticipate** when both attack, **Strike vs Strike → trade** (both hit), and
**Anticipate vs Anticipate → whiff**.

**Resolution table** (result shown for the row player):

| you ↓ \ them → | **Gather** | **Evade**         | **Strike**                | **Anticipate** |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Strike**     | you hit    | your Force → them | trade (both hit)          | you hit        |
| **Anticipate** | —          | you hit           | you're hit                | —              |
| **Gather**     | +1 Force   | +1 Force          | you're hit                | +1 Force       |
| **Evade**      | —          | —                 | their Force → you (min 1) | you're hit     |

*Enders* (a strike connected → the duel ends): **you hit / you're hit / trade**. Everything
else is the **non-connecting dance** — the duel continues and Force builds.

**Force.** A single count per side (no face-down state). Each Force **doubles** the connecting
hit: damage = `base × 2^Force`, routed through the armor/toughness pipeline (§2). **Gather**
adds +1. The **only** way Force changes hands is **Strike into Evade**: you commit a Strike,
they slip it, and your Force **goes to them** — your own momentum turned against you — and the
evader **always gains at least 1** Force from the slip, even when the Striker had none (a clean
dodge always buys momentum). Force is
**per-duel** (it resets each duel); only **health** persists between duels. There is **no Force
cap** (unlimited) — building is bounded in practice by ends-on-strike (the duel ends the
instant a blow connects), not by a ceiling. The kit is **infinite-replay**: every card is
always available each beat (no finite hand or discard yet).

**WHY.** The kit is always complete, so a perfect guesser can always answer the card in front
of them — that is what makes the reachability invariants hold for a whole duel.
Ends-on-strike keeps duels short and makes the build-then-land arc tense: you stack Force in
the dance, but the opponent controls whether your loaded blow ever connects. The single steal
vector is re-derivable from one idea — *only an active dodge (Evade) of a committed Strike
reverses; the passive build (Gather) never steals* — and it is the Gandalf-vs-Balrog engine:
a weak fighter can heist a loaded Strike, but reaching for the win is where the trade kills
them (north stars #2 computable, #4 asymmetry, #10 re-derivable).

> **Analyze as a counter system.** The Clash is a (Force-weighted) counter system — balance it with the
> counter-system tools in [`docs/game-theory/`](../../../../game-theory/hierarchy-of-concerns.md)
> ([measurement-mechanics](../../../../game-theory/measurement-mechanics.md)). And because each beat is a
> **hidden, simultaneous** commit against an adaptive opponent, equilibrium play *here* is **mixed**
> ([`solution-concepts.md`](../../../../game-theory/solution-concepts.md) §4) — this is exactly the
> quarantined mind-game layer the open PvE skeleton (a pure maximizer, §0.1 / §0.4) excludes.

**GUARANTEES** — under perfect guessing (the analytical lens: *"I happened to guess right"*):
1. **Avoid.** You can pass a duel **un-hit** — every attack has a defense that negates it
   (Strike↦Evade, Anticipate↦Gather).
2. **Land.** You can force a connecting hit — every move has an answering attack
   (Gather↦Strike, Evade↦Anticipate, Strike↦Strike-trade).
3. **Not both, free.** Landing on a committed Striker means **trading** a hit. *Survival is
   free; victory costs exposure.* (Whose hits actually land on whom is set by the breadth
   layer — §3: offense lands, a Focus-defense is reset.)
- **Termination.** Ends-on-strike resolves duels in practice (blind guesses → someone
  eventually misreads → a strike connects); the §1.6 backstop only covers the theoretical
  perfect-mutual-defense edge.

**MANUAL.** *Each beat pick a card: Strike (hit where they are) or Anticipate (where they'll
go) to attack; Gather to hold your ground and build Force; Evade to dodge. A connecting strike
ends the duel; slip a Strike with Evade and you steal their Force (always at least 1).*

**Glossary.** *(Encyclopedia terms — the in-app rules reference is generated from these `TERM`
lines, so it can't drift from this Spec.)*

- **TERM.** `The Clash` (Clash module) — An optional 1v1 mix-up that replaces a same-range trade. Each beat both pick a card and reveal at once: Strike, Anticipate, Gather, Evade.
- **TERM.** `Cards` (Clash module) — Strike beats Gather; Anticipate beats Evade; Gather beats Anticipate; Evade beats Strike. Strike also beats Anticipate; Strike-vs-Strike trades.
- **TERM.** `Force` (Clash module) — Gather builds +1 Force; each Force doubles your connecting hit. Evading a Strike steals the striker's Force (always at least 1).

### 1.1 Edge is per-duel, public, all-or-nothing, linear

> **SUPERSEDED by §1.0 (The Clash).** The tracked Edge meter is replaced by **Charges**
> (durable ×2 cards). The intent below — a *per-duel, public, no-runaway-hoard*
> escalation resource — carries forward: Charges reset each duel, are face-up, and a
> defended Charge flips down rather than compounding.

**RULE.** Every duel starts at **0 Edge** for each side. Edge is built and spent
**inside that duel only** and **does not carry** to any other duel — not even
between two duels involving the same Actor. Both banks are **public**. Spending
Edge spends **all of it** (no partial commit). A spent bank of *n* contributes
exactly *n* (linear).

**WHY.** A per-duel meter is the big simplifier: it removes the cross-round
hoarding, stalling, and runaway-snowball problems a fight-long meter creates, and
keeps the tactical exchange small and computable (Charter §2: *computable
tactics*). Public + all-or-nothing makes it a clean yomi read ("respect the
meter") rather than a hidden-quantity guessing game. Read intent-first, a
side's Edge is *the trouble the other side ran into by overextending into the
clash* — which is why it accrues only inside a mutual engagement (§1.8): with no
one reading you there is no overextension to punish, so no Edge is banked by
either side. Edge is the price of a contested exchange, never a free resource.

**GUARANTEES.**
- No fight-long bank exists; breadth never compounds into one mega-bank (a "god"
  facing many foes is a stack of independent short duels, powerful in each, never
  one accumulating super-bank).
- A bank of *n* can never do more than *n* — no one-shot-from-hoarding.
- Both players can always see the stakes; nothing about Edge is hidden.

### 1.2 The four stances and the triangle

> **SUPERSEDED by §1.0 (The Clash).** The four stances become the **six moves**
> (Strike/Throw/Parry/Evade + Charge/Recover). The intent below — **no dominant
> option**, a throw that beats the block so no stance is safe — carries forward as the
> §1.0 cycle (each attack beats one defense, loses to the other; Throw beats Parry).

**RULE.** Each fighter secretly commits one of **Marshal · Unleash · Overwhelm ·
Parry**; reveal simultaneously.
- **Marshal** *(neutral)* — bank Edge; exposed to Unleash.
- **Unleash** *(strike)* — pour all Edge into a blow; beats Marshal and Overwhelm;
  loses to Parry.
- **Overwhelm** *(throw)* — drive all Edge through a guard; beats Parry; **whiffs**
  (loses its Edge for nothing) against a non-guard (Marshal or Unleash).
- **Parry** *(block)* — beats Unleash; loses to Overwhelm.

The offensive triangle is **Unleash ▸ Overwhelm ▸ Parry ▸ Unleash**; Marshal is
the neutral that feeds it. **Unleash is the only stance that needs no read** — you can
always just swing; **Marshal, Overwhelm, and Parry require reading the foe** (Focus,
§1.8), so an Actor that hasn't read can only Unleash.

**WHY.** Three stances (Marshal/Unleash/Parry) leave a safe square: always-Parry
negates every Unleash with no downside. Overwhelm dissolves it — the throw beats
the block — so no stance is safe (Charter §2/§3: a non-degenerate, learnable
hidden-information game).

**GUARANTEES.**
- There is **no dominant stance**: always-Parry is punished by Overwhelm;
  not-parrying is punished by Unleash.
- Marshal carries no offense — it only banks and exposes — so escalation is always
  a real risk, never free.

**MANUAL.** *Marshal: ready and gather. Unleash: spend everything on a strike.
Overwhelm: punch through a guard. Parry: read the strike, negate it, and steal the
bank.*

### 1.3 Ends-on-strike

> **RESTORED — current in §1.0.** The interim charge duel tried Body-attrition (run until a
> Body hits 0); the four-card Clash **reverts to ends-on-strike**: a duel ends the instant a
> strike connects. Force is built during the non-connecting dance and spent on the one
> connecting blow (`base × 2^Force`); **Body persists across duels**, so a fight to the death
> is several short duels, not one long beat-count. The stance/Edge specifics below are
> superseded, but the *principle* — connection = end — is current.

**RULE.** A 0-Edge Unleash is still a strike. The duel **ends the instant any
Unleash or Overwhelm connects** (mutual included). The only committed attacks that
do **not** end it are a **parried Unleash** (negated and stolen — roles flip) and a
**whiffed Overwhelm** (no guard to break). All non-connecting pairings (both
Marshal, Marshal vs Parry, Marshal vs Overwhelm, Unleash vs Parry, Overwhelm vs
Overwhelm, Parry vs Parry) continue.

**WHY.** Because a base strike already ends it, the mind-game is **opt-in**: if
neither escalates, someone pokes and it's over fast; escalation is push-your-luck.
"Caught while charging" needs no special rule — you just take the hit.

**GUARANTEES.**
- Every duel has a finite, short expected length (a single throw, not a long
  dance).
- No bespoke "interrupt" rule is needed; connection = end.

### 1.4 The Parry steal — the comeback

**RULE.** Parry vs a real Unleash: the Unleash is negated and the Parrier **takes
the Unleasher's entire Edge**. If the Unleash had **0 Edge**, the Parry instead
earns **+1 Edge** (a parry always pays). An **Overwhelm is never stolen**.

**WHY.** The steal is the game's biggest comeback — the lead flips mid-duel — and
"a parry always pays" keeps Parry from ever being a dead move, without making it
safe (Overwhelm still beats it).

**GUARANTEES.**
- A parried Unleash transfers the bank rather than destroying it (the flip).
- Overwhelm's immunity to the steal is what keeps the steal-comeback from making
  Parry oppressive.

*(OPEN — number: does a Parry also deal counter-damage, and how much? Tuning, not
yet decided.)*

### 1.5 Edge scales the card's primary effect

> **SUPERSEDED by §1.0 (The Clash).** In-duel damage now scales by **Charges**
> (`power × 2^charges`, multiplicative) rather than Edge (`+1 per Edge`, linear). The
> separation it protects — the move is the prediction, the charge is the magnitude, the
> card never telegraphs the move — carries forward. (Breadth/Action cards outside a
> Clash are unchanged; §1.7/§3.)

**RULE.** Every card has one **primary effect** (its headline). Spending Edge
scales that effect at a uniform linear rate: **1 Edge = +1 of the primary effect in
its natural unit**, added on top of the card's base magnitude. The default unit is
a strike's **1 Edge = 1 damage**; each non-damage maneuver names its own per-Edge
unit (Sunder = armor pip, Disarm = a card, etc.). No card contains bespoke
Edge-handling logic.

**WHY.** One global rule means cards never "know about" Edge — `Card = what`,
`Stance = the prediction`, `Edge = how much` stay cleanly separated, so a card
never telegraphs the stance.

**GUARANTEES.**
- Adding a card never requires new Edge rules (data-only; no redeploy).
- The Stance (hidden) is decoupled from the card (visible).
- Toughness still gates the result and Power still sets the base Edge adds to (Edge
  is additive, not a bypass).
- A breadth (multi-target) action is unopposed (§1.8), so Edge never applies to it —
  only a *duel's* primary effect scales.

### 1.6 Termination backstop *(engine rule, not public)*

**RULE.** A duel ends the instant a strike connects (§1.3), and under blind, simultaneous
guessing one eventually does (someone misreads). As an **implementation backstop only**: if
**N consecutive beats pass with no strike connecting** *(appendix: e.g. 12)* — the purely
theoretical perfect-mutual-defense case — the duel **breaks off** (both disengage; the foe
still counts as engaged, so it does not also free-hit at round end). A creature whose
instinct drives a winnable duel to the backstop is a bug.

**WHY.** Ends-on-strike (§1.3) resolves real duels via accumulated misreads; the backstop
only guards the corner case where both fighters guess perfectly forever — never a pattern a
real player produces — so it adds no rule anyone meets in play.

**GUARANTEES.**
- The backstop is invisible in normal play and is **not** part of the public rules.
- Every duel terminates: it ends on a connecting strike, or breaks off after N no-connect beats.

### 1.7 Facing a crowd — K duels, two caps

> **SUPERSEDED by §3.** The breadth model is now §3.1/§3.2: **Tempo** = the duels you start
> (results stick), **Focus** = the duels started on you (a Focus-defense is **reset** —
> survival only, no damage to the attacker), a free-hit if uncovered, and a **Tempo
> counterattack** as the only way to damage an aggressor. The linear *god ≈ party* intent
> below carries forward; the Edge/Exposed specifics do not.

**RULE.** Engaging multiple foes is **K simultaneous pairwise duels** (or one
breadth-attack — see Coordination). Two separate per-Actor pools gate K:
**Cadence/Tempo** caps how many you can sustain **offensively** (engaging each costs
the target's Cadence); **Mind/Focus** caps how many you can **predict** (covering
each costs the attacker's Cadence). When Cadence affords **K** but Focus covers only
**J < K**, the **K − J** extra duels are **one-way**: you strike, but can't predict,
so those foes **free-hit** you. Going **negative in any one pool** (Tempo or Focus) marks you
**Exposed** table-wide for the round (§3.3) — Cadence sets *whether* you can sustain a
duel, never the order duels resolve in.

**WHY.** Routes offense-at-scale through Cadence and defense-at-scale through Mind so
neither one stat owns the whole table; makes the gank (overflow free-hits) the
natural counter to a thin Mind (Charter §4: asymmetry by design).

**GUARANTEES.**
- Edge resets per duel, so breadth never compounds (consistent with §1.1).
- "Negate many" stays even in *total* across builds but capped *per body* — the
  linearity invariant the god-vs-party budget depends on.

### 1.8 Duel detection — reading is the contest

> **PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED by §1.0 (The Clash).** The **in-duel read** described below —
> "Focus unlocks your stance menu; without a read you can only Unleash" — is gone: in
> the Clash all six moves are **standing**, so there is no Focus gate *inside* a duel.
> Focus is now purely the **breadth** resource — round-end coverage of foes you did not
> engage (§3.2). What carries forward unchanged: engaging costs **Tempo** (= the foe's
> Cadence), an engaged foe does not also free-hit, breadth/self actions are unopposed, and
> a creature does not read you back (its instinct is its move, §7). Read the rest of this
> section for the breadth model; ignore its stance/Edge specifics.

**RULE.** Engaging a foe (Tempo) puts you in a **clash**, resolved by the stance mix-up
(§1.2). **Reading it (Focus) unlocks your stance menu:** with a read you have all four
stances; **without a read your only stance is Unleash** — a blind strike. The read, not
the swing, is what buys the *contest* (Parry, the throw, and Edge); a non-reader can only
swing, and it resolves through **the same duel** as everything else. So two non-readers
both Unleash — the **magnitude trade** (mutual base hits, no Edge) — and one side reading
the other is the **one-way duel** of §1.7: the reader works the full mix-up while the
blind side can only strike, so a blind swing is freely **parried** (§1.4). (Breadth and
self/ally actions read no one and stay unopposed; a foe you never engage that hits you is
a **free-hit**, §3.2.)

**WHY.** The mix-up and Edge only mean anything when you are *reading* — anticipating a
foe so you can Parry, throw, or bank. So a non-reader keeps exactly the one stance that
needs no anticipation (Unleash) and loses the three that do. Making the read the single
switch ties the whole contest to the resource that is *about* prediction, keeps Edge the
price of a contested exchange (§1.1), and **folds the old "trade" into the duel** — a
blind swing is just an Unleash, resolved by the same machinery and freely parried by
anyone reading you — so there is one resolution path, not two.

**GUARANTEES.**
- No Edge accrues without a read — you cannot Marshal without reading, so riskless
  hoarding is structurally impossible (consistent with §1.1).
- Unleash is the only read-free stance; Marshal, Overwhelm, and Parry each require the
  read (§1.2). A blind swing is therefore exploitable — a reader simply Parries it.
- Defense is never free, but its price is **Focus**, not your action: you may act
  (Tempo) *and* read attackers (Focus), yet Focus is capped by Mind, so you cannot read
  everyone — the overflow free-hits you (§3.2). Offense and defense are separate pools
  that meet only at overextension (§3.3).
- A breadth action (one action, many targets) is never a duel — you cannot read a crowd
  — so it is always unopposed (consistent with §1.5).
- A creature need not read you back: its instinct is its stance (§7). The duel is on the
  side that reads; the unread side is §1.7's one-way free-hit.

**MANUAL.** *Engage to clash (Tempo). Read the foe (Focus) to unlock Parry, the throw,
and banking — without a read you can only Unleash. No read, no contest: a blind swing is
freely parried.*

### 1.9 Resolution order — engagement first, attacks before buffs

**RULE.** When several actions resolve in one exchange, they resolve in **descending
engagement** (= descending tempo at stake), in three tiers:
1. **Duels** (reads, §1.8) — RPS, Edge, and their damage settle first.
2. **Uncontested attacks** — incoming strikes no one contested: the undefended blow
   and §1.7's Focus-overflow free-hits.
3. **Self / ally effects** — buffs, heals, and other non-engaging state changes.

Thus **attacks resolve before buffs**: a self-effect cannot negate a blow already
incoming this exchange; it takes hold from the next exchange on. Within a tier order
is immaterial: in the single-deck core all modifiers (attachments) compose **commutatively** (§5),
so nothing is order-dependent. *(The order-dependent **modifier** card-kind is retired with the chord
layer — `retired-ideas.md`; were it to return, its on-target conflicts would resolve in a **fixed
seat order**, Cadence playing no part in timing, §3.1.)* Resolution is fully deterministic.

Within a tier, **resolution order is immaterial by construction**, not by luck. Three
things make it so: each duel's rolls come from a **per-duel keyed RNG** (independent of
when it resolves); damage **accumulates commutatively** (a fixed set of strikes sums to
the same result regardless of the order applied); and **no actor is removed mid-tier** —
a Body reaching 0 is *mortally wounded*, and downs are **finalized only at the tier
boundary** (§1.3: it still lands every blow it committed). Permuting the seat order of a
tier's duels must therefore yield the identical end-state — a built-in property test;
any divergence is an order-dependent mechanic, i.e. a bug. Effects that would depend on
a **sibling duel's outcome** are disallowed within a tier — push them to the next tier
or exchange.

**WHY.** Ordering by engagement settles the contested, tempo-spending core (the
duels) before its consequences, and dissolves the buff-timing paradox with no new
system: you cannot retroactively dodge an in-flight attack by buffing, because the
attack is more engaged and resolves first. Resolving the lone intra-tier collision by
a fixed seat order keeps Cadence out of timing entirely (§3.1) and guarantees
determinism without manufacturing a contest the design does not need.

**GUARANTEES.**
- Resolution is total and deterministic given the seed — no real-time, no unresolved
  tie.
- Defense is anticipatory, not reactive: a buff played into an incoming attack does
  not save you from it (human-confirmed intent).
- Cadence never affects resolution order: every effect is order-independent (modifiers compose
  commutatively, §5; the retired order-dependent modifier would use a fixed seat key, not Cadence).
- Intra-tier resolution is order-independent by construction (keyed RNG + commutative
  damage + boundary down-checks): an Actor in K duels takes the **sum** of the blows,
  its fall decided by the total at the boundary, and — per §1.3 — it still lands every
  blow it committed. Only the cross-tier order (attacks before buffs) matters.

> **Worked example — the rock and the buff.** A foe throws a rock at me; I spend my
> action buffing myself. The buff does not contest the foe, so this is **not** a duel
> (§1.8): two unopposed actions, no Edge. They resolve by tier (§1.9) — the rock is an
> uncontested attack (tier 2), the buff a self-effect (tier 3) — so **I take the
> rock**, then the buff takes hold; even a buff granting rock-immunity is too late for
> the blow already thrown. To *avoid* the rock I would **read** the thrower — spend
> Focus to Parry it — which costs Focus, not my action, so I could buff **and** read if
> my Focus affords it. Defense is a separate pool, not a forfeited turn.

## 2. Defense model — *pile → bar → pool* 🟡

Design source: [`notes/form-and-defeat.md`](../notes/form-and-defeat.md),
[`notes/stats.md`](../notes/stats.md). Seeded below; not yet exhaustive.

> **Naming.** Combat has **one damage channel** — **Might** into the **health** pool. *(The old inner
> **Fear/Spirit** channel and the **Mind/Confusion** channel were both **collapsed out** — Mind
> 2026-06-20, Fear 2026 — so there is no per-channel split; control is the Controller's **stat-drop**,
> not a second damage track, §4 / Charter #13.)* The word *aspect* stays **reserved** for the retired
> deck-chord combo layer (§6). **Armor** and damage *types* are **deferred** to the later gear system
> (`future-possibilities.md` §7) — until then a hit has no cut.

### 2.1 One maintained meter

**RULE.** Exactly **one** quantity is a maintained, depleting track: the **health pool** (face-down
cards, per-combat, restored on a win). The other defensive quantity — **Toughness** — is a **passive
stat read off the table**, never spent. **Tempo** is an ephemeral per-round pool, re-derived each round,
not maintained.

**WHY.** "You maintain exactly one meter" is the load-bearing comprehensibility
rule (Charter §7, §9): a human can hold the whole game because only one number is
ever in flux.

**GUARANTEES.**
- Nothing besides the health pool is ever "tracked" between rounds.
- Every other defensive number can be reconstructed from the cards on the table.

### 2.2 The one channel — pile → bar → pool

**RULE.** Every attack deals **Might** (its base magnitude — the attacker's Might plus any card power),
resolved in one path: **accumulate the Might into the phase's pile (per-phase, §4.6) → compare the
pile to the bar (Toughness) → each time the pile clears Toughness, flip one health card** face-down. Empty the health
pool and the Actor is **down**. There is **no cut** today — **Armor** and damage *types* are deferred to
the later gear system (they will reinsert a pre-pile subtract). This is the game's **single
kill-condition** (Charter #13): you die exactly one way — your health pool empties.

**WHY.** One channel, one bar, one pool keeps defense readable (#7, #9): a human tracks exactly one
number (the health pool) and re-derives the rest. A high bar (Toughness) answers *any one big hit*; the
pool's count (Vitality) answers *many small ones* — non-redundant, so you want both. **Control is not a
second channel:** the Controller degrades the foe's own stats and hangs round-scoped statuses (§4), never
a parallel damage track (Charter #13).

**GUARANTEES.**
- Exactly one channel and one pool — **Might → health** — is the only way the Body is lost; there is no
  inner / fear track. *(The Fear channel and its Dread / Resolve / Ward stats were collapsed out, 2026.)*
- The Controller's **control is stat-drop, not damage** — consistent with §8.6's damage-separation law
  (Charter #13).
- Accumulation is always cards in a zone, never a number in the head.
- Armor / damage-types are **deferred, not deleted by accident** — they return as the gear system's
  pre-pile cut (`future-possibilities.md` §7).

*(SEEDED — the damage formula and scaling live in `booklet.ron`. The armor / type cut returns with
gear.)*

### 2.3 Stats live in the deck — *stats-as-deck*

> **Locked 2026-06-21.** *No actor's identity card carries stats* — hero or creature. Stats always live
> on separate **build cards**. The hero/creature difference is the build card's **lifecycle**, set by
> **progression** — not whether stats are "printed." (Refined 2026-06-21 from an earlier character-bare /
> creature-printed split into this single rule — see WHY.)

**RULE.** An actor's **identity card** is **bare** — a name, a role, a map token (§8.1), nothing more —
for **every** actor, hero or creature. All of its stats live on separate **build cards**, read as the
**Form** (§5.2 / §2.4–§2.6): so §2.1's "passive stats read off the table" — **Toughness**, and likewise
**Cadence, Finesse, Might** — are **build-card-derived**, never authored on the
identity. A build card encodes one build's stats; two kinds behave identically but differ in
**lifecycle**:

- **Hero build card** — encodes a **starting build** (a clean slate, or a pre-set scenario kit). In the
  printed game it is a **setup artifact**: at setup you instantiate the hero's Form from it, then **set
  it aside**. The live Form is thereafter the hero's stats, and it **grows** as Upgrades are added
  (§8.3/§8.5) — so the starting-build card is a template, never live state.
- **Monster build card** — encodes a creature's **fixed core stats**. It **persists** in play as the
  creature's stat representation, because a creature never progresses (the build *is* the creature).

Changeable, maintained state — the **health pool**, **Tempo** — is tracked **as normal** (§2.1),
separate from the build cards. *(Numbers live in `booklet.ron`.)*

**WHY.** "The deck *is* the character" (#8), generalised: an identity is *who*, a build is *what*, and
keeping *what* on cards makes **every point of strength a card you can point to**. The single splitter is
**progression**: a hero's Form **diverges** from any starting build (it gains cards), so that build card
can only be a setup template — keeping live stats on the assembled Form is what makes "stronger = more
cards" true. A creature **never** diverges, so its build card can *be* its standing representation. This
**refines** the earlier "character bare / creature printed" wording: putting creature stats "on the
identity card" wrongly implied two rules. There is **one** — *identities are bare; stats are build
cards* — and the hero/creature difference falls out of **lifecycle**, not of where stats are printed.

**GUARANTEES.**
- **No identity card carries stats** — hero or creature alike. Stats are always build cards / Form cards.
- **Hero build cards are setup-only:** they instantiate a starting Form and are then set aside; the live
  (and possibly grown) Form is the hero's stats. Heroes with the *same* assembled Form play identically,
  however the build was specified.
- **Monster build cards persist** as a creature's fixed stats; a creature neither gains nor sheds build
  cards in play.
- The splitter is **progression, not type**: a build that can grow keeps its card a setup template; a
  build fixed for life may persist as the representation.
- **Data note:** in `booklet.ron`, `ActorCard.base` is an **inline build card** — empty for a bare
  campaign hero (the Novice; its build is the separate clean-slate + reward cards), populated for a
  creature or a fixed scenario-hero kit (its build card, stored inline). Combat resolves every actor
  through the one Form path.

### 2.4 The two suits — *Quantity & Power*

> **Locked 2026-06-21.** Every Form stat is one of two named suits. The names are the whole stat
> vocabulary; learn them once, read them everywhere.

**RULE.** A Form card carries a **suit** and a value, and is one of exactly **two** suits:
- **Quantity** — *breadth*: how many cards (a count). Only **pooled** stats have a Quantity — **Vitality**
  (Health cards) and **Cadence** (Tempo cards).
- **Power** — *depth*: how much each card is worth (a per-card magnitude). The Powers are **Toughness**
  (per Health card), **Finesse** (per Tempo card), and the lone flat magnitude **Might** (strike force).

The suit classifies; the **deck** (§2.6) names the stat. So each stat is a **(deck × suit)** cell:
Health·Quantity = Vitality, Health·Power = Toughness, Tempo·Quantity = Cadence, Tempo·Power = Finesse, and
**Might** is the lone flat (Power-only) magnitude. A pooled stat has **both** suits; a flat stat has
**Power only**. A leaf card itself prints only *(suit, value)* — which stat it feeds is fixed by the deck
it sits in.

**Support buffs are card-driven.** With the stat collapse there is **no Inspiration stat**: a Support
augment's magnitude is printed on its card (Mend / Haste / Empower / Brace raise Vitality / Tempo /
Might / Toughness / Finesse by the card's own value). Support scales by **breadth of kit**, not by a
signature magnitude (#12: the effect Roles bend shared dials, they don't own a private one).

**WHY.** Two suits are the entire stat vocabulary, so a player learns "**Quantity = how many, Power = how
hard**" once and reads it on every stat — §2.1's count×value shape generalised from defense to all of
them, and §2.3's "the deck is the character" (#8) made addressable. **Power is the quantum of meaning**:
it sets the smallest difference the game will represent (a Toughness-4 Health card flips only after 4
damage banks), so the power-fantasy scaling pours into **Power** — huge effect, card count flat — while
**Quantity** stays small and every card on the table stays a meaningful state. The lone flat magnitude —
**Might** (strike force) — is the canonical Power-only instance of the suit: Power is the magnitude atom,
and Might is it standing alone with no Quantity.

**GUARANTEES.**
- No stat exists outside the two suits **{Quantity, Power}**.
- **Quantity** appears only on pooled stats (Vitality, Cadence); **every** stat has a Power.
- Suit meaning is **global** — Quantity is always a count, Power always a per-card magnitude; a suit is
  never rebound to a different role under a different deck.
- The five stats are **Might · Vitality · Toughness · Cadence · Finesse** — Vitality / Cadence carry both
  suits (pooled); Might / Toughness / Finesse are Power magnitudes.

### 2.5 Base-2 denominations

> **Locked 2026-06-21.** Suit cards come in powers of two, one of each — the uniquely-canonical,
> fewest-cards encoding.

**RULE.** Suit cards come in **base-2 denominations** — 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, … — with **at most one of each
denomination per suit per deck**. A stat's value is the **sum** of its denomination cards. Because no
denomination repeats, **every value has exactly one representation** (its binary expansion), and a value
*V* costs **popcount(*V*)** cards.

**WHY.** One-of-each base-2 is the **unique, minimal** encoding: there is never a second way to show 18
(= 16 + 2), so a value reads and renders unambiguously, and card-count = set-bits = **O(log V)** — a stat
can scale into the power-fantasy range while the table stays sparse (§2.4: scale via Power, keep Quantity
small). The base also fixes the game's **natural numbers**: balance values gravitate to powers of two and
their sparse sums — an intentional binary aesthetic, and a ready cost metric (popcount).

**GUARANTEES.**
- One copy max of each denomination, per suit per deck → the canonical (binary) form is unique.
- A stat's card-cost is **popcount(value)**; doubling a stat is **+1 card** (one new denomination).
- **Consumable interaction:** decrementing a consumed Quantity pool (the Health pool) past a high denomination
  "makes change" — the digital UI re-renders the canonical form; a printed edition may instead hold a
  *consumed* pool at unit denomination. Read-once Power stats are always free to denominate.
- The popcount cost is a **tiebreaker only** — it never overrides a balance target, and it never collapses
  stats that differ by reset clock (§2.7).

### 2.6 The deck hierarchy — *positional notation*

> **Locked 2026-06-21.** A character's Form is a tree of decks; a card's meaning is its path.

**RULE.** A character's Form is a **tree of decks**, and a leaf card's **meaning is its path**. The root
is the bare identity card (§2.3); its children are the **stat decks** (Health, Tempo, Might, …); a stat
deck's children are its **suit decks** (Quantity, Power); the **leaves** are the base-2 denomination
cards. A deck's **face shows its rolled-up total**; opening it reveals the addends that sum to it. **Only
leaves carry values** — an intermediate deck is pure position, never a number.

**WHY.** Positional notation is what lets the **generic** denomination cards (§2.5) be reused across every
stat: a "Power 4" leaf means Toughness under Health and Finesse under Tempo — meaning comes from the **path**,
not the card, so the print vocabulary collapses to *{denomination × suit}*. The tree also **enforces
position for free** (a card can't be orphaned — it lives inside its deck) and **maps to physical
containment** (nested banded bundles). Deck-face = sum is §2.1's "read it off the table" made navigable:
the total you act on, the addends you audit.

**GUARANTEES.**
- A leaf's meaning = *(its path) × (its denomination)*; the same leaf under two decks is two different stats.
- Only leaves hold values; a number on an intermediate deck is a defect — meaning lives at exactly one level.
- A deck's face equals the **sum** of its contents (Form is commutative, §5.2 — order within a deck is irrelevant).
- Positional encoding governs the **static Form tableau only** — never a shuffled or drawn pile. Action
  cards (§5) stay intrinsically meaningful; you may not positionally encode a deck you draw from.

### 2.7 Reset clocks — *when mitigation discards*

> **Locked 2026-06-21.** A mitigation layer is defined by *when* it discards, not only how much.

**RULE.** A defensive layer carries a **reset clock** — when the damage it absorbs is discarded — and the
clock is part of the stat. The Health channel stacks three:
- **Armor** — **per hit**: the cut applies to each blow independently; sub-cut damage is discarded at once.
- **Toughness** — **per round**: damage banks into the round's pile and flips a Health card each Toughness;
  the sub-Toughness remainder clears at round end (§2.2).
- **Health (Quantity)** — **per encounter**: a flipped Health card stays flipped until combat ends
  (restored on a win, §2.1).

The clock is **orthogonal to magnitude** — the same Power can sit on any clock — and choosing the clock is
a design dimension in its own right.

**WHY.** The clocks are **non-redundant because they counter different damage *shapes***: per-hit Armor
erases **many small** hits (each shaved in full); high per-round Toughness lumps **few big** hits into
rare, meaningful flips; per-encounter Health is raw, shape-agnostic capacity. Keeping all three is
**several strategies toward one end (survival)** — armor and a tough hide are *different on purpose*, and
"it matters *when* they discard" is precisely why they do not collapse into one stat (the §2.2 WHY's
"many small vs any one big," generalised to a timing axis). The clock is also where new mitigation
flavours are **minted without new complexity** — a per-exchange or per-attacker cut is a fresh strategy at
the same card cost.

**GUARANTEES.**
- Every mitigation layer names a reset clock; two layers of equal magnitude on different clocks are
  **distinct** stats, not duplicates.
- The popcount tiebreaker (§2.5) breaks ties **within** a clock, **never across** — it must never collapse
  Armor into Toughness.
- The clocks form a **closed, named set** per channel; adding a clock is a Spec change (a new mitigation
  kind), not free data.

## 3. Cadence · Finesse · Tempo — *the breadth budget* 🟡

Design source: [`notes/speed-and-tempo.md`](../notes/speed-and-tempo.md).

> **Locked 2026-06-20.** The breadth economy is the three terms below, ratified together. Earlier forms
> (two pools Tempo/Focus; a per-target-Cadence cost; a value-less Tempo) are superseded — see the §3.2–3.4
> history banners. This section is the **single canonical home** for what Cadence, Finesse, and Tempo are;
> any change that makes one of these three words do another's job has broken the concept (the GUARANTEES
> are the tripwires).

Two permanent **Form** stats size one round-scoped **pool of cards** — the same shape as Health
(Vitality × Toughness → Health):

- **Cadence** — *count*: how many **Tempo** cards you start each combat round with.
- **Finesse** — *grade*: the magnitude printed on each of those cards.
- **Tempo** — the *pool*: Cadence-many cards, each worth Finesse, flipped face-down to spend and rebuilt
  fresh each round. **Spent cards stay spent for the whole round.**

### 3.1 What Tempo and Finesse do

**RULE.** **Flipping a Tempo card gates every *action*** — a strike, a block / slip / evade, a strike
back. **Standing in a position, letting a foe slip by, and *absorbing* a blow are free** — Tempo is the
currency of acting on the enemy, not of mere presence. Tempo **refills each round** (§4), but a round's two
phases **share it**: run dry within a round and you can take no more actions that round (you still hold your
position and soak with health).

**Finesse's magnitude does real work in exactly one place — the *Tempo contest* — and nowhere else.** The
contest is one primitive: each side commits Tempo cards worth (cards × Finesse), and **the side trying to
*avoid* the strike must *strictly exceed* the other; a tie lands the strike.** It covers every defense —
**slipping** past a melee blocker and **evading** a ranged shot are the same race (§4 / §4.2). Bid cards
are spent and do **not** return, so contesting *more*, or *harder*, drains more Tempo — the attrition that
decides the battle.
- **Block / slip** (melee, §4): a defender out-bids a melee attacker to hold or avoid the blow. A **group**
  **sums** its Tempo to block, but needs **every** member to beat the attacker to slip (§4.5).
- **Evade** (ranged defense, §4.2): a defender out-bids a ranged attack — Artillery damage **or** a
  Controller debuff. The attacker may **press** with extra cards (its **volley**); the defender's bid must
  strictly exceed the volley — a tie or less and the attack lands.

**Everywhere else, Finesse's number is irrelevant — only the flip counts.** A **strike** is
**single-card**: flip *one* Tempo card to strike, and the blow is the same whatever the card's Finesse
(Finesse sizes a **contest**, never a blow). An enemy can only attack you by
**spending a Tempo card**, and the blow's force is Finesse-independent. Against a **melee** strike you may
**reflexively strike back** (position is irrelevant — they came to you) for **one** Tempo card; against a
**ranged** strike you may **evade** it (the Tempo contest above) or strike back **if you carry the
range** — with no Tempo to spend you simply **take the hit** (a free hit).

**WHY.** One pool for act-and-defend makes the cannon/wall axis a live **allocation** (spend it
attacking and you cannot answer an attacker) rather than a second stat. Splitting the pool into
**count (Cadence)** and **grade (Finesse)** gives two clean power dimensions that mean different things:
**Cadence = how many actions you get; Finesse = how cheaply you win each contest.** Confining
Finesse to the **contest** keeps a strike's force on Might (not on how hard you slipped or held), and the
**within-round** depletion is the tension — press your contests hard and you are spent for striking
(#2 opportunity cost).

**GUARANTEES.** *(the tripwires — break one and the concept no longer holds)*
- **Cadence = count**, **Finesse = grade** — both permanent Form stats, never spent; **Tempo = the cards**,
  Cadence-many at Finesse each, **spent within a round and refreshed between rounds** (the round's two
  phases share one pool, §4).
- **Finesse's magnitude affects only a *Tempo contest*** — block / slip / evade (a single simultaneous
  bid; the avoider must strictly exceed, a tie lands the strike); it never scales a strike or anything
  outside a contest.
- **Every action is one Tempo card** (strike, contest, evade, strike back); **standing and soaking are
  free**; a strike is single-card and Finesse-blind.
- **Spent Tempo does not return until the round refresh** — cards bid on a contest are unavailable for the
  rest of the round (within-round attrition); a **Recover** verb (§5) can return one mid-round.
- **Against a melee strike, reflexive strike-back** is available for one Tempo card; **against a ranged
  strike, evade** (the contest) or strike-back if in range; no Tempo → a free hit.

**Glossary.** *(Encyclopedia terms — generated from these `TERM` lines into the in-app reference.)*

- **TERM.** `Cadence` (Resources) — A permanent Form stat: how many **Tempo** cards you start each combat round with (the *count*). It is not a magnitude of movement and never sets turn order.
- **TERM.** `Finesse` (Resources) — A permanent Form stat: the magnitude on each **Tempo** card (the *grade*). Its number matters only in a **Tempo contest** — block / slip / evade — where both sides commit Tempo cards (cards × Finesse) and the side avoiding the strike must strictly exceed (a tie lands the strike). A strike's force is the same whatever its Finesse.
- **TERM.** `Tempo` (Resources) — The round's pool of action cards: **Cadence**-many, each worth **Finesse**. Flip one to take any action (strike, block / slip / evade, strike back) — standing and soaking are free; spent cards stay spent until the round refresh (shared across the round's two phases; a **Recover** verb can return one mid-round, §5).

### 3.2 Focus — *merged into Tempo (2026-06-20)*

> **MERGED.** Focus is no longer a separate pool. Defense-in-place — turning an incoming melee blow into
> a **clash** rather than a **free hit** (§4 skirmish) — is now **paid from Tempo** (§3.1). The **Mind**
> stat and the separate Focus pool are **removed**; the cannon/wall split becomes a Tempo *allocation*
> (spend it all attacking and you cannot answer a skirmisher). The old separate-defense-pool rules
> (defense resets the attacker; per-target Focus cost) retire with it. *(Original text in git history.)*

### 3.3 Overextension — *removed*

> **REMOVED.** The old **Exposed / Focus→0** penalty (overextending Tempo zeroed your Focus)
> is gone. Tempo and Focus are **independent** breadth pools, each hard-capped by its stat,
> and the offense/defense balance now lives entirely in the **Cadence-vs-Mind split** — a
> high-Cadence/low-Mind fighter natively attacks widely but defends poorly, and the reverse —
> so no coupling penalty is needed. **Pay-after is kept** (§3.1): the action that drives a
> pool negative still happens and is your last, but it carries **no extra penalty**.

### 3.4 The round — orchestration (PvE & PvP)

> **SUPERSEDED by §4 (engagement-schedule model).** The round is no longer a player-phase/foe-phase loop
> over formation; it is the **declare intentions → engagement schedule → reset** round-loop model in §4.
> **Tempo is now the single currency** (Focus/Mind merged out, 2026-06-20); order-independence is preserved
> *per engagement*. The
> PvE/PvP text below (and its Focus-defend modes) is kept for design history; where it conflicts with
> §4, §4 wins.

**RULE.** Combat is a sequence of **rounds**. Two orchestrations share the same duel
resolver (§1.0), economy (§3.1–3.2), and formation/reach layer (§4); which runs depends on
whether **both** sides are player-controlled.

**PvE round** — player heroes (multi-action) vs instinct creatures (one-action, §7):
1. **Formation** *(public, §4)* — front/back visible; heroes may shift freely.
2. **Player phase** — each hero spends **Tempo** to **engage** reachable foes (cost = the
   foe's Cadence). Each engagement is a **mutual** Clash (results stick: the hero can kill, the
   foe can hit back, the trade is live). An engaged foe **spends its one action defending**,
   so it does **not** also attack this round (engaging neutralizes its attack).
3. **Foe phase** — every **un-engaged** living creature attacks a reachable hero (by its
   target rule, §7). The attacked hero picks a **defense mode**: **Focus-defend** (Focus →
   attacker reset, survive only), **counterattack** (Tempo → mutual, can kill, trade live), or
   **eat the free hit** (base damage, no Force). A foe neither engaged nor covered free-hits.
4. **Refresh** — downs finalize at the boundary (§1.9); survivors reset Tempo/Focus; **Body
   persists**; round++.

**PvP round** — both sides player-controlled (multi-action, so no "engage neutralizes"):
1. **Formation** *(public, §4)* — visible; free shift.
2. **Targeting** — *simultaneous hidden commit → reveal.* Each actor allocates Tempo to
   reach-legal engagements. Reveal the engagement graph; mutual engagements (A→B **and** B→A)
   **merge** into one mutual Clash.
3. **Defense** — *simultaneous hidden commit → reveal.* Each actor under a one-sided attack
   picks its mode (Focus-defend / counterattack / eat) per attacker, from remaining
   Focus/Tempo. **Modes are public on reveal.**
4. **Combat** — all live duels resolve in **lockstep beats** (each beat: every duelist commits
   hidden, all reveal together, all resolve; ended duels drop out), to ends-on-strike.
5. **Refresh** — as PvE.

**WHY.** PvE's asymmetry (multi-action heroes vs one-action creatures) lets the proactive
player phase **use up** a foe's single action by engaging it — a simple, readable proactive→
reactive flow. PvP can't: both sides are multi-action (everyone attacks *and* defends) and
neither may reveal first, so targeting must be **simultaneous**. Splitting **decisions**
(targeting, defense) from **resolution** (combat) is what makes order irrelevant within every
phase.

**GUARANTEES.**
- **Order-independent within each phase:** every targeting/defense decision is committed before
  any duel resolves; duels are independent (no cross-duel effects, §1.9); downs finalize at the
  boundary — so resolving duels in any order yields the identical end-state.
- **No turn order:** one whole side then the other (PvE), or both at once (PvP); Cadence sizes
  pools and costs, never initiative (§3.1).
- **One engine:** both orchestrations call the identical Clash and economy; only the round
  skeleton differs, justified by one-action creatures vs multi-action players.

## 4. The battle — hold the front, break the line, deal from the back 🟡 *(**engagement-schedule model**, 2026 — supersedes the attrition model; **code pending**. Three declared intentions, one Tempo contest, a five-round battle on a per-round Tempo budget, resolved over a fixed engagement schedule.)*

> **History.** Superseded forms: front/back formation → cadence-pairing → lane assignment → the
> **charge-and-gauntlet** → the **static-ranks** model (three ranks, two tiers, a Finesse crossing contest,
> catch / slip / parting hits, Fast / Slow windows) → the **attrition** model (two positions, the Outrider
> *emergent* from grouping's sum-vs-min, the back opened only when the whole front fell). The *spine
> survives across all of them* — a front that shields a back, **declared** positions, force-not-fiat, the
> playstyle triangle, the glass-cannon back. The current **engagement-schedule** model below makes one
> deliberate reversal and one simplification: it **re-introduces the Outrider as a declared third
> intention** (validated 2026 — see `log-driven/brainstorming/phases.md` and the `engagement.rs` sim), and
> it replaces the attrition model's *emergent* breaker — a freed Vanguard charging through a per-unit lock,
> plus the sum-vs-min slip machinery built to make the Outrider *pop out* — with a breaker you simply
> **declare**. **Motivation (force vs fiat, the designer's call):** naming the Outrider is **honest fiat** —
> it declares a *plan* the player chooses, which can *fail* (a misplaced Outrider is screened, runs dry, or
> bounces off Toughness) and which nothing is immune to (the back is reachable by *anyone*, §4.6; the
> Outrider is only *more efficient*). The emergent construction was a *page of machinery* to avoid a
> *one-word label*; the consequences (the RPS triangle, each role necessary, force-not-fiat) stay emergent
> from the schedule + Tempo economy, proven on numbers ≤ 3. The crossing contest, catch/slip, and Fast/Slow
> windows stay retired; the **per-phase pile, the pre-empt, cast/resolve, and disrupt** (§4.6) carry forward
> unchanged — the engagement schedule *is* their named ordering.

**The budget (one per-round pool, shared across the whole schedule).** **Tempo** is the action economy
(§3): a `count × value` pool of **Cadence**-many cards, each worth **Finesse**, that **refills at the end
of every round.** **Acting on the enemy spends Tempo** — *every* attack, and *every* defense (block, slip,
or evade), is a Tempo bid; **standing in a position and *absorbing* a blow are free.** The **whole round's
engagement schedule shares the one budget — it does *not* refresh mid-round**, so Tempo spent early (a
dodge in the Intercept, a raid in the Raid) is gone by the late engagements — the **opportunity cost is the
balance engine** (a Rearguard that spends its shot on a raider has none left for the enemy front, and dies
to it later). **Health does *not* reset** — it is the **cross-round** meter that decides the **five-round**
battle. **Finesse is read only in a Tempo contest** (a bid); a strike's *damage* is set by **Might**.

**RULE — three declared intentions.** Each side secretly **groups** its Actors (§4.5) and declares each
group's **intention** for the round, then both reveal. An intention is a *plan* — declaring it is free; it
pays off only if the stats and the schedule bear it out (force-not-fiat: a misplaced intention simply
fails):

- **Vanguard** — **hold the line** (front). The position that **can be hit**, and the **shield**: *while a
  side's Vanguard lives, its Rearguard cannot be targeted.* It screens the enemy Outriders, fights the enemy
  front, and cleans up last (§4.6).
- **Outrider** — **break the line** (flank). It forgoes the Vanguard's shielding and the Rearguard's safety
  to **raid the enemy Rearguard directly** — but it is **exposed both ways**: the enemy front screens it and
  the enemy back fires on it *before* it strikes (the schedule, below). A fragile, high-Tempo body that gets
  *through* and back out; a blob cannot (groups slip weakest-link, §4.5).
- **Rearguard** — **deal from the back**. **Untargetable while its own Vanguard lives;** from safety it
  fires on the enemy front (ranged), buffs allies, and degrades foes — and it is the side's **only
  answer to an enemy Vanguard's Toughness** (the glass cannon).

**Reach = where you can attack from.** Range is **position-determined** (§4.2): a **melee** Actor strikes
from the **Vanguard** (the front) or as an **Outrider** (raiding across the gap); a **ranged** Actor deals
from the **Rearguard**, reaching over its own line. Positions **self-sort by attack type** — a ranged body
declared Outrider, or a melee body parked in the Rearguard, is dead weight (no rule bans it; it is just
ineffective).

**The structure — declare, then walk the engagement schedule.** The battle runs **five rounds, or until a
side is dead.** Each round:

1. **Declare Intentions** *(hidden, simultaneous — every round).* Each side secretly **groups** its Actors
   (§4.5) and assigns each group an intention — **Vanguard / Outrider / Rearguard** (re-declared each round).
   *(The hidden commit matters only under the Versus / Clash layers; in PvE the foe's intentions are
   scripted and open — §0.1.)*
2. **Reveal Intentions.** Reveal together; nobody moves. Positions are now open.
3. **Pre-Battle (Standing).** Standing effects — buffs / braces (Support mends, Wall braces) — are cast now:
   ally-targeted, auto-land, last the round (the §4.6 Standoff / §4.4 `cast: standing`).
4. **The engagement schedule.** The round's strikes resolve over a **fixed sequence of role-vs-role
   engagements** (below). Each engagement is a §1.9 boundary: declare → resolve → apply (the per-phase pile,
   §4.6; deaths finalize, §1.3).
5. **Reset (the Lull).** All spent Tempo resets; **Health carries over**; round++ (cap **5** — an unresolved
   battle is a draw, §0.4).

**The engagement schedule — the one ordering system.** Every attacker→target role-pair is resolved in a
fixed order; *every legal pair appears exactly once* (Rearguard→Rearguard is the lone illegal pair — a
back-line trading shots with a back-line it cannot reach, §4.6). The **order is the whole interception /
pre-empt / Reckoning machinery** — there are no other timing rules; a unit struck in an earlier engagement
takes no action in a later one (§4.6 PRINCIPLE):

| Step | Name (diegetic) | Engagements | What the fiction is |
|------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| a | **Intercept** | Vanguard → Outrider | the front screens the crossing flankers |
| b | **Volley** | Rearguard → Outrider | the back fires on the crossers (it shoots *before* they arrive — the pre-empt) |
| c | **Raid** | Outrider → Rearguard | flankers that survived strike the exposed back |
| d | **Clash** | Rearguard → Vanguard, Vanguard → Vanguard | the back snipes the enemy front; the fronts meet |
| e | **Breach** | Vanguard → Rearguard, Outrider → Vanguard, Outrider → Outrider | the deep / trailing blows land last |

This is **consult-on-ambiguity precedence, not a five-step procedure** — a table collapses "everyone attacks
their target" into "obviously," and a player reaches for the order only when two events would resolve in a
sequence that changes the outcome and isn't obvious (does my Outrider kill the Mage before it fires? — Raid
is before Clash, so yes). The names are **diegetic** so the order is *reconstructable* from the picture, not
memorized (the back fires at a crosser before it arrives; you cannot hit what is behind a living wall; your
committed blow lands after they answer it). The opportunity cost falls straight out of the order on a shared
budget: an Outrider must pay to dodge the Intercept **and** still afford the Raid (its extra Tempo card); a
Rearguard that spends its shot screening a raider in the Volley has none left to crack the enemy Vanguard in
the Clash — *going around the design costs you the action you needed for it.*

**The one contest — attack vs. block / slip.** Every attack is a **single simultaneous Tempo bid**; the
defender answers by spending Tempo to **beat it — strictly (a tie lands the hit).** *One* mechanic covers
**slipping** past a melee blocker (pushing toward the back) and **evading** a ranged shot (§4.2) — melee
or ranged, it is the same race. Both sides spend what they commit (the attrition). Because the defender
must spend **more** to win, **defending is Tempo-negative** — a pure defender bleeds faster than its
attacker, runs dry first, then **eats the hit**, so blows always connect in the end and **Health / Might
stay load-bearing.** There is **no iterated raise-war** — one committed bid each, higher wins (§0.4:
combat stays a *maximizer*, not an equilibrium-solver). **Force, not fiat:** out-bid any defender and the
hit lands; spend past what your foe can answer and nothing is immune — opposition is always *cost*.

**Groups — sum to block, weakest-link to slip.** A group that **blocks** pools its members' Tempo into one
summed bid (a strong hold); a group that **slips or evades** needs **every member to individually beat the
attacker** (weakest-link). So a group is a superb **wall** and a hopeless **slipper** — the body that
gets through the line as a raider is a **lone, high-Tempo Outrider**, not a blob (§4.5). *(The Outrider is
now a **declared** intention; sum-vs-min no longer has to **conjure** the breaker, only to price grouping —
a grouped Outrider trades its raid for a wall.)*

**Demise — protection is the front's, and only while it stands.**

| Position                          | Dies to                                                                                              | Safe from                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Vanguard** (front / shield)     | the enemy Rearguard's fire (Clash) and enemy Vanguards (Clash) / Outriders (Breach); the **exposed** front by design | nothing — being the shield *is* its job |
| **Outrider** (flank / breaker)    | the enemy front that screens it (Intercept) **and** the enemy back that fires on it (Volley) — exposed both ways, *before* it strikes | nothing — it forgoes both the shield and the safe back |
| **Rearguard** (back / cannon)     | the enemy **Outrider's raid** (Raid), and — once its own front falls — enemy fire and any melee that crosses | the raid aside, **everything while its own front holds** |

So each intention buys one thing at the price of another: the **Vanguard** trades exposure for the shield it
projects; the **Outrider** trades *all* protection for direct back-access; the **Rearguard** trades reach
for safe, decisive damage — safe from everything *except* the breaker built to reach it. The core decision
is the **allocation** of bodies and Tempo across the three.

**Role powers (re-homed to the one contest).** With no crossing or catch, powers now bite the **Tempo
bid** or the **exposed-back strike** instead: e.g. **Bulwark** (+block bid for every allied Vanguard — the
line holds as one), **Assassinate** (a strike on an exposed Rearguard hits hard enough to empty its pool — the §10
prize). The crossing-only riders (Phalanx-hold, Taunt-first-catch, Blitz-free-slip, Shadowstep-win-ties)
**retire** with the crossing contest; where still wanted they re-express as Tempo-bid modifiers. *(The
exact power list is an open dial.)*

**Controller debuffs — evadable ranged attacks.** A Controller fires debuffs from the **Rearguard** as
**ranged attacks** (§4.2): the target may **evade** them (the Tempo contest) or eat them, exactly like
Artillery fire — but they deal **no damage** (Charter #13), they **degrade**. A landed debuff hangs a
round-scoped status or drops a stat:
- **Status:** **Stagger** (cannot act), **Disarm** (cannot play role cards), **Rout** (driven **out of the
  Vanguard** — it stops shielding, so its own Rearguard is exposed: the front-breaker *without* a kill).
- **Stat-drop:** lower **Might / Toughness / Finesse**, or **drain Tempo** — a lowered Finesse weakens both
  its slips *and* its evades; drained Tempo hastens its bleed-out.

**Force, not fiat** holds: enough volley always lands (you evade only what your Tempo affords), no foe is
immune. *(The old fear/Dread channel is **gone**; the Controller applies these directly as evadable ranged
attacks. Each debuff's strength, and whether Rout can fire before contact, are seeded — tune to taste.)*

**Two ways the back opens — the raid, and the fall.** A Rearguard is reached **two** ways, both *earned*
(force-not-fiat): by the **Outrider's raid** (the declared breaker crosses and strikes it directly in the
Raid — *if* it survives the enemy Intercept and Volley), or by **the front falling** (once a side's
Vanguard is gone, its back is open to fire and to any melee that crosses — the Breach's `V→R`). The
Outrider buys *early, direct* access at the price of total exposure; waiting for the front to fall is *late*
but free. Until one of those happens, the living front shields everything behind it.

**Targeting matrix** *(who may strike whom — the engagement schedule fixes the order; here is the reach).*

| Chooser                | May strike                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vanguard** (melee)   | enemy **Outrider** (Intercept) → enemy **Vanguard** (Clash) → enemy **Rearguard** once its front is down (Breach) — screener, then primary force, then cleanup |
| **Outrider** (melee)   | enemy **Rearguard** (Raid — its purpose) → enemy **Vanguard** / **Outrider** (Breach) if no back is reachable                        |
| **Rearguard** (ranged) | enemy **Outrider** (Volley) and enemy **Vanguard** (Clash); the enemy **Rearguard** once *its* front is down; and **aids its own allies** (auto-land buffs) |

No one may strike an enemy **Rearguard** while that side's **Vanguard** lives **and** no Outrider has
reached it — the back is shielded until cracked. Friendly fire does not exist — ally-targeted effects are
**buffs only**, and they auto-land.

**Edge cases.** *No Vanguard (all-Rearguard):* with no front to shield it, **your Rearguard is exposed
from the start** (the "while its front lives" clause never holds), and the enemy front closes untouched —
holding everyone back only exposes you. *No Rearguard (all-Vanguard):* a pure front — durable, with
nothing to expose, but short on the safe damage cannons give; it wins by out-lasting, not out-gunning.

**Protection is the front's, and momentary.** Only a **living Vanguard** shields the back; the instant it
falls — killed or Routed — the back is reachable. **No position is ever permanently safe** — every unit
dies to enough Tempo (the **force-not-fiat** invariant, §0.3 / BI-3): a back is safe *because* a front is
paying for it, never by rule.

**Determinism.** Each phase resolves from a snapshot, **order-independent within** (permuting the units
yields the identical end-state — the §1.9 property); effects **accumulate to a boundary** where deaths
finalize (§1.3: a mortally-wounded unit still lands every blow it committed). The Tempo contest is a
**single simultaneous bid** (not an iterated raise-war) and the battle is **capped at five rounds**, so
it is **bounded and perfect-information given each round's blind bid** (#11) — a maximizer, par
well-defined (§0.4). The only hidden, simultaneous mind-game is the optional **Clash** (§1.0).

**What is hidden.** Only each round's **blind bid** — groups, positions, and standing cards — and only
until the simultaneous reveal. Everything after is open; Tempo is flipped face-up to spend. Always public:
stats (Cadence / Vitality) and the spent / unspent pool.

**WHY.** One physical picture — a **front**, a **flank**, and a **back** — and a finite Tempo budget spent
across a **fixed order**. The three declared intentions **are** the playstyle triangle, mediated by the
schedule + economy (validated on numbers ≤ 3 — `engagement.rs`):

- **Outrider = Aggressor** — break the line to reach the cannons. **Beats the Rearguard** (the Raid kills
  the glass cannon before it can win); **loses to the Vanguard** (the Intercept screens and drains it, so it
  reaches the back empty — or dead).
- **Rearguard = Glass-Cannon** — deal from safety. **Beats the Vanguard** (only its Might cracks the front's
  Toughness, and it never has to reach it); **loses to the Outrider**.
- **Vanguard = Turtle** — hold the line. **Beats the Outrider** (screen-and-drain in the Intercept); **loses
  to the Rearguard** (a tank it cannot reach is out-gunned).

`Outrider ▸ Rearguard ▸ Vanguard ▸ Outrider` (= `Aggressor ▸ Glass-Cannon ▸ Turtle`). Each leg is the
*efficiency* of doing your job versus going around it: the breaker that the front drains, the cannon the
breaker reaches early, the wall only the cannon's Might can crack. **Force, not fiat:** out-bid any
defender, over-power any wall, declare any intention — opposition and back-access are always *cost*, never
decree (the Outrider is only the *efficient* path to the back, never the *only* one); and "beat, not match"
guarantees blows eventually land, so Health and Might never become decorative.

> This three-cycle is a **counter system** — a clean 3-element RPS, so the counter-system hierarchy
> applies directly (no Condorcet winner, regular, uniform Nash):
> [`docs/game-theory/`](../../../../game-theory/hierarchy-of-concerns.md). It is a *playstyle* cycle
> *inside* the matchup, **not** a faction-level RPS — the distinction in
> [`nested-counter-systems.md`](../../../../game-theory/nested-counter-systems.md). Note the cycle only
> *bites* under the hidden **blind bid** (the simultaneous, adaptive layer where reads pay off); with bids
> open it folds back into the pure maximizer (§0.1 / §0.4).

**GUARANTEES.**

- **Three declared intentions:** Vanguard (front / shield), Outrider (flank / breaker), Rearguard (back /
  cannon); reach **self-sorts** them (melee fights from the Vanguard or raids as an Outrider, ranged deals
  from the Rearguard). Declaring an intention is free and may *fail*; nothing is decreed by the label.
- **The back is reachable two earned ways** (force-not-fiat): an enemy **Outrider's raid** (it survived the
  Intercept and Volley), or **the front falling** (the Breach's `V→R`, once that side's Vanguard is gone).
  The Outrider is the *efficient* path, never the only one; a back's safety is always *paid for*, never
  decreed.
- **One fixed engagement schedule** is the sole timing system: every legal attacker→target role-pair
  resolves once, in order (a–e), and a unit struck in an earlier engagement takes no action in a later one
  (§4.6 PRINCIPLE). The order is **consulted at ambiguity**, not performed each round.
- **One unified Tempo contest:** a single simultaneous bid; the defender must **beat, not match** (ties
  land); **no iterated auction**, so combat stays a maximizer (§0.4). Defending is Tempo-negative → blows
  always connect in the end → Health / Might stay load-bearing.
- **One per-round Tempo pool, shared across the whole schedule:** it refills each round but does **not**
  refresh between engagements — the opportunity cost across the order is the balance engine. **Health
  persists**; the battle is capped at **five rounds**.
- **Groups:** sum-to-block, weakest-link-to-slip; single-target damage **spills** in declared order
  (bodyguarding), **AoE hits all** (bypasses spillover), acting costs **one Tempo per member**; **Hoard X**
  is a one-card group of X bodies (§4.5).
- **Force, not fiat:** every position is killable by enough Tempo — no immunity, no hard cap. A no-skills,
  infinite-Tempo character wipes any finite party (BI-3).

**MANUAL.** *Group your Actors and declare each group's intention — **Vanguard** (hold the front),
**Outrider** (break the line, raid the back), or **Rearguard** (deal from the back) — and play standing
buffs / braces, all in one hidden commit. Reveal; no one moves. Strikes then resolve over the fixed
**engagement schedule**: the front screens crossing Outriders, the back fires on them, surviving Outriders
raid the back, the lines clash, and the deep blows land last. Every attack is one Tempo bid the defender
must **strictly beat** to block, slip, or evade (a tie lands; a group **pools** Tempo to block but needs
**every** member to beat it to slip). All of it is paid from **one Tempo pool that does not refresh
mid-round** — spend it early and you reach the late engagements empty. Standing and soaking are free.
At round end Tempo refreshes, Health carries over; the battle runs **five rounds** or until a side is dead.*

**Glossary.** *(Encyclopedia terms — generated from these `TERM` lines into the in-app reference.)*

- **TERM.** `Declare intentions` (Roles) — Each round opens with a hidden, simultaneous commit: each side groups its Actors, assigns each group an intention — Vanguard (front), Outrider (flank), or Rearguard (back) — and plays its standing buffs / braces. Intentions are re-declared every round. Revealed together; everything after resolves in the open, nobody moves.
- **TERM.** `Vanguard` (Roles) — The declared front: hold the line. The position that can be hit and the shield — while a side's Vanguard lives, its Rearguard is reachable only by an Outrider's raid. Melee Actors fight from here; it screens enemy Outriders, then fights the front, then cleans up.
- **TERM.** `Outrider` (Roles) — The declared flank: break the line. Forgoes the shield and the safe back to raid the enemy Rearguard directly — but is exposed to the enemy front (Intercept) and back (Volley) *before* it strikes. A lone, high-Tempo melee body; a group cannot raid (slips weakest-link).
- **TERM.** `Rearguard` (Roles) — The declared back: deal from safety. Untargetable while its own Vanguard lives and no Outrider has reached it; from the back it fires on the enemy front (ranged), buffs allies, and degrades foes. The only answer to an enemy Vanguard's Toughness.
- **TERM.** `Engagement schedule` (Combat) — The fixed order strikes resolve in each round: Intercept (Vanguard→Outrider), Volley (Rearguard→Outrider), Raid (Outrider→Rearguard), Clash (Rearguard→Vanguard, Vanguard→Vanguard), Breach (Vanguard→Rearguard, Outrider→Vanguard, Outrider→Outrider). The order is the whole interception / pre-empt / Reckoning system; consult it only when timing is ambiguous.
- **TERM.** `Tempo contest` (Combat) — The one attack-vs-defense mechanic: a single simultaneous Tempo bid (cards × Finesse); the defender must strictly **beat** it (a tie lands the hit) to block a melee blow, slip past a blocker, or evade ranged fire. Defending is Tempo-negative, so blows eventually land. No iterated raise-war.
- **TERM.** `Reach` (Combat) — Where you can attack from: melee strikes from the Vanguard or raids as an Outrider, ranged deals from the Rearguard. Positions self-sort by attack type; a misplaced unit is idle, not barred.
- **TERM.** `Group` (Combat) — Same-side Actors bound at form-up into one unit: one position, one shared target, distinct Health. Single-target damage spills in declared order; AoE hits every member; acting costs one Tempo per member; blocking sums member Tempo, slipping needs every member to beat the attacker. No size cap, no mixed positions.
- **TERM.** `Hoard X` (Combat) — A creature whose X health cards each act as a separate entity — mechanically a built-in group of X one-health bodies (a swarm): sums to block, cannot slip, melts to AoE, and loses an attack per body killed.
- **TERM.** `Spillover` (Combat) — Accumulated single-target damage on a group applied point-by-point in declared order, overflowing to the next member when the current can no longer absorb it.

**Open dials (pin with implementation).** The structure (the per-round declared intentions, the engagement
schedule, the one Tempo contest, the three declared intentions, reach, targeting, the five-round cap) is
settled; these are not:

> **SUPERSESSION (2026).** The static-ranks ratification (2026-06-21) — three ranks, two tiers, the
> crossing contest, card-bound catch, Shadowstep / Phalanx / Bulwark / Blitz riders — is **retired** by
> the attrition model above. The **resolver-of-record changes accordingly** (`combat.rs` is code-pending,
> no longer `the_line`). What carries over: a **single simultaneous bid** (not an iterated auction), so
> base PvE stays a **maximizer**, not an equilibrium-solver — par well-defined (§0.4).

1. **Bid & damage magnitudes** — the contest *rule* is locked (single simultaneous Tempo bid; the defender
   must **beat, not match**; ties land); the **numbers** (bid grades, strike Might) live in `booklet.ron`,
   human-tuned.
2. **The Tempo budget** — its size per Actor (Cadence) sets how much each round affords; **per-round refresh
   and the two-phase shared pool are locked**; the **five-round cap** is the master length dial.
3. **Role-power list** — which crossing-era powers re-express as Tempo-bid modifiers, plus the new
   block-bid / exposed-back powers (Bulwark, Assassinate, …).
4. **Rout's reach** — whether a Controller can Rout a Vanguard *off the line* (exposing its back) before
   contact, and how strongly.
5. **Group action-cost** — **one Tempo per member to act** is the price of grouping (§4.5); confirm it
   against the par solver alongside AoE-vulnerability and target-lock.
6. **Pool model — locked (§3):** **Health = Vitality × Toughness** (persists cross-round), **Tempo =
   Cadence × Finesse** (refreshes each round, shared across the round's two phases). Finesse reads only in a
   Tempo contest; a strike is Finesse-blind (Might sets damage); **standing / soaking cost no card at all**.

*(Range/attack dials remain resolved by §4.2: melee fights from the front, ranged from the back; a
same-range meeting is a trade / Clash, an off-range or unanswered blow auto-hits.)*

### 4.1 Count-adaptivity — the system degrades to the choices that exist

**RULE.** The commitment layer is **count-adaptive**: any choice with a **single legal option
resolves automatically**, presenting no decision. **Position assignment**, **grouping**, and **targeting**
appear only when party size makes more than one option legal. Concretely:

- **1 v 1** — each side has one Actor; positions are moot (front meets front), so the two simply **trade**
  (or fight a **Clash** with the module on). No position bluff, no group, no back to shield — it is exactly
  the plain duel (the tutorial case).
- **Small parties (2–3)** — only live choices surface: **position assignment** becomes real once a second
  body makes a front-vs-back split meaningful; **grouping** once two same-position bodies can bind; and
  **targeting** only with a surviving target and a legal line to it.
- **Larger parties** — the full picture (a bluffed formation, groups walling and lone units slipping,
  fronts falling and backs opening).

**WHY.** Complexity should scale with the number of bodies. The protection layer only *means*
something when you have an ally to protect, so it must be invisible until then — keeping 1 v 1
the clean duel/Clash and ensuring the interface never shows an option that cannot matter at the
current head-count.

**GUARANTEES.**
- 1 v 1 reduces to the §1.0 duel/Clash with **zero** added decisions.
- A choice is presented **iff** it has ≥2 legal options; single-option phases auto-resolve.
- Adding bodies only *adds* choices; it never changes how the smaller case played.

### 4.2 Range & attack type — melee, ranged, both, or neither

**RULE.** Every Actor's offense is **melee**, **ranged**, **both**, or **neither**. Range is
**position-determined** (§4): a **melee** Actor strikes from the **Vanguard** (the front) or as an
**Outrider** (raiding the enemy back across the gap); a **ranged** Actor strikes from the **Rearguard**,
over its own line. A strike lands at its range;
how the target may answer depends on the range:

- **Melee, same range (target can strike back)** → a **simultaneous trade** (both deal their base through
  toughness, §2). With the **optional Clash module** (§1.0) on, the trade becomes the four-card Clash + Force.
- **Ranged** → the target may **evade** (the Tempo contest, §3.1 — spend Tempo, strictly beat the
  attacker's pressed volley; a tie lands the hit) **whatever its own range**, and may additionally
  **strike back** if it carries the range. A blow neither evaded nor answered is an **auto-hit** (through
  toughness).

The **Clash is a module, not the floor** — the game is fully playable with same-range = trade
(see `future-possibilities.md` Entry 3: the strategic layer is rich without RPS).

What follows from it:

- **Melee belongs in the Vanguard, ranged in the Rearguard.** A melee unit can only fight from the front
  (where it is also the shield); a ranged unit fires from the safe back. Positions **self-sort by attack
  type**; a melee unit parked in the back is dead weight until the front breaks and the distance closes.
- **Rearguard self-defense = whether it carries melee.** Once its front has fallen, a Rearguard with a
  melee attack can **trade / Clash** a melee attacker that reaches it; a pure caster (no melee) is
  **auto-hit** (assassinated).
- A **melee-less Vanguard is legal but a very bad idea** — it is the front, it takes the blows, and it
  cannot answer in melee. (Emergent positioning, not a banned move.)
- **Neither** = pure support (heal / buff / area-control): it makes no attacks, so it is **auto-hit in
  melee** once reached — though it may still **evade ranged fire** with Tempo (§3.1). The most
  decisive-yet-fragile Rearguard piece, wholly dependent on the front. Its kit is Action cards over the §5
  zone layer.

**WHY.** Range turns the **front/back split** from intent into mechanics: a melee unit must be up front to
act (and is the shield); ranged fires from safety; an exposed caster with no melee is auto-hit once
reached. It also opens clean power-design space: keep-at-range tricks, strong-at-ideal / weak-off-range
hybrids, and pure-support "neither" kits — each re-derivable from "do you have the attack for this range?".

**GUARANTEES.**
- A **melee** strike at the same range is a trade / Clash; a **ranged** strike may be **evaded** with Tempo
  (§3.1) by any target and **struck back** only by a same-range answerer; a blow neither evaded nor
  answered **auto-hits** (through toughness).
- Range is **position-determined** (Vanguard = melee, Rearguard = ranged) — never the attacker's free pick.

**Glossary.** *(Encyclopedia terms — generated from these `TERM` lines into the in-app reference.)*

- **TERM.** `Trade` (Combat) — A same-range melee engagement: both sides deal their base through toughness. In the optional Clash module, the trade becomes the four-card mix-up.
- **TERM.** `Evade` (Combat) — A ranged defense: spend Tempo to dodge a ranged attack (the tempo contest, §3.1) — your evade (cards × Finesse) must strictly beat the attacker's volley, a tie lands the hit. Any target may evade, whatever its own range.
- **TERM.** `Auto-hit` (Combat) — A ranged or off-range blow the target neither **evades** (Tempo) nor strikes back: it lands uncontested through toughness.
- **TERM.** `Attack type` (Combat) — Each Actor is Melee, Ranged, Both, or Neither. Melee strikes from the Vanguard; ranged fire from the Rearguard. Lacking the matching attack means you can't strike back — but you may still evade ranged fire with Tempo.

### 4.3 Actors are decks — *stats-as-deck & the schema*

**RULE.** An **Actor is a deck**, not a stat-block. In `booklet.ron` the actor entry is a **bare
identity** — `name`, `role`, `driver`, **attack type** (§4.2) — that **carries no flat stat fields**;
its stats live on **build cards**. Its numbers are **read off the Form** (§2.3 / §5.2): a **fundamental**
build card (base stats, incl. Health = Vitality × Toughness, §5.5) plus any **attachment** cards, summed
commutatively (§5.5). Per §2.3 the fundamental rides as the actor's inline **`base`** build card — *empty*
for a bare campaign hero (its build is the clean-slate + reward cards) and *populated* for a creature or a
fixed scenario kit. The §3 / §4 economy reads stats from the Form exactly as before (**Cadence sizes
Tempo**); only the *source* moved from flat fields to the deck.

**Schema migration (this `/spec-sync` pass).**
- `ActorCard`: **drop** every flat stat field (`might / vitality / toughness / cadence / finesse`) and
  `weapon / traits`; **keep** `name / role / driver / attack`; carry stats **only** via the inline
  **`base`** build card (a `StatCard`) plus reward / attachment cards.
- A **`StatCard`** carries one card's contribution over the **five** stats and **nothing else** — no
  channel / armor / damage-type fields (deferred with gear, §2.2). A **`Form`** = `base` + attachments,
  summed into the `Offense` / `Defense` the engine reads.
- The runtime **`Actor` derives `offense` / `defense` from its `Form`** at build time (commutative sum) —
  the totals are always recomputable from the cards, never an independently-authored block.
- The `booklet.ron` data, the Rust `ActorCard` / `StatCard` structs, and the §4 reader land **together**
  in this pass; this Spec is what they conform to.

**WHY.** One representation — the deck — for what a character *is* and *does*; the authored stat-block
was a redundant parallel that drift could split from the cards (§2.1, #10). It also makes the Upgrade
economy (§8) mechanically real: buying a card literally raises a stat.

**GUARANTEES.**
- An Actor's numbers are always recomputable from its deck — no hidden stat-block.
- The §3 / §4 economy is unchanged in *behavior*; only the stat **source** moved (card → deck).
- A card works identically on a player and a creature (§8.4 deck-recipe creatures also build decks).

### 4.4 Role-card play — the ability layer 🟡 *(respecced 2026-06-20; per-side cap 2026-06-23; **cap removed → tempo-gated, offensive spells Rearguard-cast 2026**; **abilities are tempo-gated Form cards, no card-spend 2026-06-25**; code pending)*

**RULE.** Role cards are an **ability layer** over the physical battle (§4), and they live on the
**Form** (§5.2) — **open, permanent enablers**, never drawn. **Casting is an action:** each use spends a
**Tempo card** (§3) — competing with strikes, contests, and evades for the one budget. An ability is
**repeatable**: using it does **not** Spend or exhaust it, so it may fire **as often as Tempo allows**
(the same ability may even resolve in more than one phase — §4.6 cast/resolve). The lone exception is an
explicit **one-shot**, which flips **face-down for the combat** (never resets — a non-recovering Spend;
this is how a once-per-combat capstone is built, §5.6 M1). There is **no per-suit or per-side cap**: how
much magic a side throws is bounded only by its **Tempo** (a conserved, party-size-invariant pool) and
the foe's **evade**.

**Target classifies; reach positions.** An ability is **offensive** or **support** by **what it
targets**, not by its reach:
- **Offensive** = a **foe-targeting** effect (a Damage strike, and every Controller debuff / status —
  Mark · Mire · Sunder · Defang · Burn · Shove · Rout · Stagger · Disarm · Suppress · Slow · Confuse ·
  Silence · Pin). It is `cast: Strike`, **contested**, and its **casting position and defense come from
  its `reach` (§4.2)**: a **ranged** offensive ability is **cast from the Rearguard** and **evaded** (the
  tempo contest, §3.1); a **melee** offensive ability is **cast from the Vanguard** (the front), a
  **trade**.
- **Support** = an **ally-or-self** effect (Brace · Cover · Haste · Empower · Mend · Thorns · Ward, and
  the like). It is **not an attack**: `cast: Standing`, **rank-free**, **auto-lands** (uncontested),
  castable from **any** position, and lasts the engagement.

So the "a Vanguard cannot rain offensive spells" gate is **not a separate mechanism** — it **falls out of
§4.2** (ranged fires only from the back): an offensive *ranged* ability needs the Rearguard because *all*
ranged attacks do. **Reach only *positions* an attack within the offensive/support split; it never
*classifies* it** — a melee strike and a ranged shot are both attacks, and a melee offensive ability
(Shield Sweep, Slip Strike) is correctly Vanguard-cast, not Rearguard-gated. A foe-debuff and an
ally-buff are different in kind even at the same reach; the *target* is the robust axis.

**WHY.** The old **per-suit cap** (≤1/suit, ≤5/side, any party size) was a *fiat* conservation lever. The
stat collapse makes it **redundant**: casting now spends **Tempo**, and Tempo is **already conserved**
across party size (Cadence rides on a fixed card pool that party size only *partitions* across bodies). So
**god ≈ party (#4) falls straight out of the tempo economy** — total casting output is party-size-invariant
*because total Tempo is*, with no hard cap. The cap's other jobs are covered too: **Tempo itself**
prices same-ability repetition (every use costs a Tempo card — no exhaust clock needed), and **evade**
(§3.1) gives every offensive spell built-in counterplay. Dropping it is **force, not fiat**: a side may **concentrate** (more spells, fewer strikes)
or **spread**, paying Tempo either way — opportunity cost, never prohibition (#2; emergence over fiat,
#6 / #12).

Making **offensive *ranged* casting Rearguard-only** is the replacement god-vs-party lever, and a
*positional* one: a god cannot both **hold the Vanguard** and **rain offensive ranged spells** in one round
— it must **hold back** to cast, paying a real lane-coverage cost (the concentration-vs-resilience
tradeoff, candidate **BI-4**).
Buffs stay rank-free because they are not attacks — Support mends the line from any rank. **Cross-suit
combos** (degrade → fire → buff) are still *rewarded* — the suits differ in kind (#12) — just no longer
*required* by a one-per-suit rule. Effects stay **additive / commutative**: each feeds an accumulator
resolved at its window boundary and **no played effect multiplies or gates another's output** (§0.1 /
#11), so a "combo" is diverse effects in a round, never a multiplying chain. Because the **blind-bid commit
is simultaneous**, a card is committed up front or resolves in the contest — never *held* for a
more-informed hidden moment.

**GUARANTEES.**
- **No per-suit / per-side cap, and no exhaustion.** Casting is bounded only by **Tempo** (each use =
  one Tempo card) and **evade** (offensive spells) — both *costs*, never prohibitions. An ability is a
  **repeatable** Form enabler; it never Spends (a **one-shot** self-limits by flipping for the combat).
- **Conservation across party size via Tempo.** Total Tempo is party-size-invariant (fixed Cadence-card
  pool), so total casting output is too — **god ≈ party** is the N=1 partition, not an exception. No party
  size dominates role-card throughput (candidate **BI-4**, par-solver-verified).
- **The offensive/support split is by *target*, never by reach.** **Offensive** (foe-targeting) abilities
  are **positioned by reach** (§4.2): a **ranged** one is **Rearguard-cast and evadable** (so a body
  **cannot** rain offensive ranged spells from the **Vanguard**); a **melee** one is **Vanguard-cast, a
  trade**. **Support** (ally/self) abilities are **rank-free standing cards** (`cast: Standing`, auto-land,
  any position).
- **Order-independent effects.** Every effect feeds an accumulator at its window boundary; **no played
  effect multiplies or gates another's output** (§0.1 / #11) — the result is order-independent however many
  a side fires.

*(History: the original **matching-position gate** (a card required its own rank) was removed 2026-06-20;
the **per-suit / per-side cap** that replaced it is now removed too (2026) in favour of tempo-gating. The
surviving position rule is narrower and **emergent** — abilities are classified **by target** (offensive =
foe-targeting; support = ally/self), and only an offensive *ranged* one is positioned, because *all* ranged
attacks fire from the Rearguard (§4.2). Code/data + `TERM` lines land with the role-card migration; §4.4
was already code-pending — `role-card-redesign.md` §8.)*

### 4.5 Groups — bind same-side Actors into one unit 🟡 *(engagement-schedule model, 2026)*

**RULE.** At **form-up** (§4), a side may bind several Actors into a **group**. A group shares **one
position** (all Vanguard or all Rearguard — never mixed) and **one target** at a time, with **no size
cap**. Within a group:

- **Distinct pools, spillover damage.** Each member keeps its own Health and **dies individually**.
  Accumulated **single-target** damage is applied **point-by-point in declared order**, **spilling over**
  to the next member once the current can no longer absorb it (a tank in front soaks for the squishies
  behind).
- **AoE hits every member at full value** — the standing risk of clustering; it bypasses the spillover
  queue and strikes each body.
- **Acting costs one Tempo per member.** A group attacks, or makes a contested defense, only when **every**
  member spends a Tempo card — so a big group is durable but **tempo-hungry**, and bleeds its own budget
  fast.

**Groups in the Tempo contest (§4) — sum to block, weakest-link to slip.**

- **Blocking pools Tempo:** members combine their bids into one **summed hold** — a group is a superb
  **wall**.
- **Slipping / evading takes the minimum:** **every member must individually beat** the attacker
  (weakest-link), so a group is a **hopeless slipper**. The unit that reaches an exposed back is a **lone,
  high-Tempo** body, not a blob.

**Hoard X.** A creature whose **X Health cards each act as a separate entity** is mechanically a **built-in
group of X one-Health bodies** — a swarm. It sums those X to block, can essentially never slip (each tiny
body must win its own race), **melts to AoE** (X× hits), and **loses one attack per body killed**. So the
swarm archetype falls straight out of the group rules, and a swarm can be authored as **one card** rather
than X.

**WHY.** A group buys **durability** (shared spillover Health behind a front member) and **focus-fire**
(its members' attacks concentrate on one target). It pays threefold: **AoE-fragility** (every member hit),
**target-lock** (one target at a time), and **per-member Tempo** (it bleeds the attrition budget faster).
The sum-vs-min asymmetry then sorts groups with **no special case** — a group **walls**, a lone fast unit
**slips** — so a **grouped Outrider cannot raid** (only a lone, high-Tempo one can): the price of grouping
for the breaker. *(The Outrider is now a **declared** intention, §4; sum-vs-min no longer has to conjure it,
only to price the choice to group.)*

**Why the fiction forces these asymmetries** *(documented so interpretation can't drift):*

- **Sum to block, min (weakest-link) to slip / evade.** Holding a line *pools*: shields abreast make one
  stronger wall, so blocking **sums** every member's Tempo. Sneaking past or dodging does **not** pool — a
  sentry foils a crowd by catching **any one** of them, so a group is only as unseen as its **most-spotted**
  member, and a slip is gated by the **weakest** link. One infiltrator need only slip *himself*; a band must
  each slip, unseen, at once — far harder, but **never barred** (force-not-fiat: if every member out-bids,
  the whole group slips, just at brutal cost). The mistake to avoid: a group **cannot** pool a dodge the way
  it pools a block — you can't combine ten clumsy sneaks into one quiet one.
- **A cluster is target-rich — *easier* to hit, not harder.** Packed bodies are a **fat, dense** target:
  anything with **width** — a fireball, a cleave, a loosed volley — cannot whiff against a crowd and need not
  *pick* a victim; it lands on **all** at full value (bypassing the spillover queue). Only single, **aimed**
  fire still strikes one body (and spills in declared order). So bunching up trades **evasion for exposure**
  — the exact mirror of the slip penalty, and the standing price of the durability a group buys.
- **Hoard X is this taken to the limit.** A swarm is the group dialed to the extreme — many one-Health
  bodies — so it is **maximally** target-rich (one AoE shreds X at once) and **maximally** un-slippable (each
  tiny body must win its *own* race, and one card each is a hopeless weakest-link). Its cheap mass and summed
  wall, and its AoE-death and nil infiltration, are **not new rules** — they are these same group tradeoffs
  at their maximum, which is exactly why a swarm is authored as **one card**, not X.

**GUARANTEES.**
- One position, distinct pools, one shared target; no merged stat-block, no size cap, no mixed positions.
- Single-target damage **spills** in declared order; **AoE hits every member**; **acting costs one Tempo
  per member**.
- **Block = summed Tempo; slip / evade = every member beats the attacker** (weakest-link).
- **Hoard X** = a one-card group of X one-Health bodies (swarm).

### 4.6 The engagement schedule — resolution order, the pile, the pre-empt & disrupt 🟡 *(2026 — supersedes the six-phase / per-unit-lock model; the round resolves over the declared-intention schedule of §4; the per-engagement pile, `cast`/`resolve`, pre-empt, and disrupt carry forward; code pending)*

> **Supersedes** the six named phases (Standoff / Fray / Volley / Breach / Reckoning / Lull) and the
> **per-unit lock / freed-Vanguard charge.** The *spine* holds — a front shields a back, you reach the back
> by **winning**, force-not-fiat — and the per-engagement pile, the pre-empt, `cast`/`resolve`, and disrupt
> all carry over unchanged. What changes: the round resolves over the **declared-intention engagement
> schedule** of §4 (Intercept / Volley / Raid / Clash / Breach), and the breaker is a **declared Outrider**
> with its own engagement (the Raid), not a Vanguard that freed itself through a per-unit lock.

**PRINCIPLE — why there are engagements at all (re-derive timing questions from this).** *Within* a single
engagement, damage is applied **order-independently** (§1.9): every strike and defense is **committed up
front** and the whole engagement resolves together — *including the blows of a body that dies in that same
engagement* (§1.3: a mortally-wounded unit still lands every blow it committed). The **only** reason to
split the round into separate engagements is to impose a **timing order between them:** a unit **dead at an
engagement boundary takes no further action**, so a death can **preclude** what happens in a *later*
engagement but can never reach back into an *earlier* one. Every schedule rule is a corollary — the
**Intercept and Volley pre-empt the Raid** (an Outrider screened or shot down before the Raid never
strikes), a **disrupted caster's deferred spell fizzles** (no caster left at the last engagement), and a
**committed defense is spent whether or not it succeeds** (it was locked before resolution). When a new
timing question arises, decide it from this one rule: **put two effects in the same engagement if they
should *trade* (both land); in ordered engagements if one death should *silence* the other.** *(This is why
humans can collapse the schedule in their heads and consult the order only when an outcome is genuinely
ambiguous — §4.)*

**RULE — the round resolves over the schedule; each engagement is a boundary.** A round runs: **Declare
Intentions** (hidden) → **Reveal** → **Pre-Battle** (Standing effects auto-land) → the **engagement
schedule** a–e (§4) → **Reset** (the Lull: Tempo re-derived from the Form — borrowed Tempo does not return,
§5.5 — Health persists, round++). Each engagement is a §1.9 boundary (declare → resolve → apply; accumulate,
then lock; deaths finalize, §1.3). All Tempo across the whole round is paid from **one shared per-round
pool** (no refresh between engagements, §4).

**RULE — the accumulator is per-engagement.** Each engagement owns a **per-target pile**; a landed hit adds
**Might** to the pile of its **`resolve`** engagement, and when the pile clears **Toughness** one Health
card flips (overflow wasted). **Every pile wipes at its own engagement boundary** — sub-threshold damage
does **not** carry between engagements (this **refines §2.2** from "the round's pile" to *the engagement's
pile*). **Health persists** (§2.1); only the sub-threshold pile is ephemeral. Effects that share a
`resolve` engagement **stack in that pile** (additive, order-independent — §0.1: a combo is diverse effects
in one pile, never a multiplying chain). *Consequence:* **Toughness is a per-engagement wall**, so burst
within one engagement beats chip spread across them — revisit Toughness values in `booklet.ron` (numbers
are human-tuned, `0-source-of-truth`). *(Motivation: tabletop legibility — no pile-number ever crosses an
engagement boundary, so the only number a human carries through the round is Health.)*

**RULE — back-access (who may strike the Rearguard).** Two earned routes, both gated by the schedule order:
- **The Outrider's raid** — a declared Outrider strikes the enemy Rearguard in the **Raid** (c), **if it
  survived** the enemy front's **Intercept** (a) and the enemy back's **Volley** (b). The breaker *declares*
  the raid (no per-unit lock); its cost is total exposure *before* it lands.
- **The front falling** — once a side's Vanguard is gone, its Rearguard is open to the **Breach**'s `V→R`
  (a Vanguard crossing the now-open ground) and to ranged fire. This is *late* (the last engagement) but
  needs no Outrider.

A Rearguard is shielded until one of these cracks it; neither is by decree (force-not-fiat — you reach the
back by **winning** the Intercept/Volley as an Outrider, or by **killing** the front).

**RULE — `cast` & `resolve` (carried forward).** An ability's timing is **two fields**:

- **`cast`** — where you may pay Tempo and commit it: **`standing`** (Pre-Battle — own-side buffs / braces,
  auto-land) or **`strike`** (any engagement in which the unit may act per reach + back-access; default).
- **`resolve`** — which engagement's pile the effect lands in. A card **authors one of two**: **`on-cast`**
  (the engagement it was used — the old *instant*; a Rearguard may fire on a raider in the Volley *and* on
  the enemy front in the Clash; the default) or **`reckoning`** (the old *deferred* — paid up front, lands
  in the **last** engagement of the round; that deferral is the **only** reason a breacher can disrupt it).
  The Outrider's **raid** and the Vanguard's **breach** are not authored resolves — they are the timing of
  their **scheduled engagement** (Raid / Breach), exposed to the earlier pre-empt by construction.

**Legal targets are derived, not enumerated:** a card declares only its window; *what it may hit* comes from
**reach** (§4.2) + back-access (above). The **disruption window** is the gates between `cast` and `resolve`:
`on-cast` ⇒ zero ⇒ **undisruptable** (§1.3); `reckoning` ⇒ the engagements in between are exactly where a
death can silence it.

**RULE — the rear pre-empts the raider.** A raiding Outrider is **not** special: in the **Intercept** the
enemy front may strike it, and in the **Volley** the enemy back may fire on it — both **before** the
Outrider's Raid blow lands (the schedule order). Any §3.4 response (dodge, strike-back, counter-fire) from
the shared pool applies. So the rear can drop or drain the breaker before it arrives — *and a Rearguard that
spends its shot doing so has none left for the enemy Vanguard in the Clash* (the opportunity cost, §4).

**RULE — interception & flanking.** The **Intercept** (a, `V→O`) is the front's screen on crossing
Outriders — a Vanguard that kills a raider there **precludes** its Raid (dead at the boundary). A Vanguard
with no Outrider to screen falls back to the **Clash** (`V→V`) and then the **Breach** (`V→R`) — screener →
primary force → cleanup (§4). An Outrider with no reachable Rearguard falls back to the **Breach**
(`O→V`, `O→O`).

**RULE — disrupt.** Default disrupt = **kill the caster before its `reckoning` resolves** (no caster, no
spell). Dedicated **non-lethal disruption** (stagger / silence / unseat) may **cancel or delay** a deferred
spell without a kill. Both cash out the same way: a deferred spell resolves only if its caster reaches the
last engagement able to cast.

**WHY.** The schedule *is* the timing system — one fixed order replaces a pile of per-effect timing rules,
and every consequence (interception, pre-empt, Reckoning) is just a position in it. The **Intercept/Volley
before the Raid** is the theme made mechanical: a flanker crossing open ground is screened by the front and
shot at by the back *before* it arrives, so breaking the line is push-your-luck — you suffer their answer to
reach them. Deferring a slow spell to the last engagement is the caster's own bet — *dear and late*: a big
effect that lands **only if it survives** the round it provoked. And **one shared pool** makes every strike,
defense, raid, counter-shot, and spell a single **allocation** — the opportunity cost across the schedule is
the balance engine (§4).

**GUARANTEES.**

- **The schedule is the sole timing system:** every legal attacker→target role-pair resolves once, in the
  fixed order (a–e); a unit dead at an engagement boundary takes no later action. No other timing rule.
- **Back-access is earned two ways:** the Outrider's declared Raid (survived Intercept + Volley) or the
  front falling (Breach `V→R`) — never by decree (force-not-fiat).
- **Pre-empt:** the Intercept and Volley resolve **before** the Raid, so the front's screen and the rear's
  fire can stop a breaker before it strikes.
- **Per-engagement pile:** Might accumulates within an engagement and **wipes at its boundary**; Toughness
  is a per-engagement wall; only Health crosses boundaries.
- **`cast`/`resolve`:** `on-cast` is undisruptable; `reckoning` lands last and is disruptable by killing or
  unseating the caster first; the raid/breach take their scheduled engagement's timing.
- **One pool:** every action across the whole schedule is paid from the single per-round Tempo budget.
- **Force-not-fiat preserved:** you reach the back by winning (the raid) or killing the front (the breach),
  never by decree; every position still dies to enough Tempo.

*(Worked round to be regenerated for the engagement schedule:
`log-driven/combat-logs/designer/card-combat-round-breach.md`.)*

## 5. Zones / exhaustion — *the card state-machine* 🟡

The post-Clash rewrite of the orphaned exhaustion economy. Full design background:
`zones-exhaustion-design.md`. **Exhaustion replaces cooldowns:** cards-only (#7) forbids a hidden
timer, so using a card **moves it to a visible spent zone** until restored — which is exactly #8's
*"unpredictability erodes as cards exhaust, restored at a tempo cost."* Everything here is
**intra-encounter** (full reset at the Day boundary; strategic layer / `progression-design.md`).

> **Realizes north star #8 via zones.** #8's predictability-as-resource carries over intact (no
> luck; a managed, eroding resource restored at a tempo cost), but its *mechanism* moves from a
> never-shuffled **deck order** to **zone state**. The Charter's #8 still says "decks… order is
> intent"; updating that line is a deliberate Charter act left to the designer — **flagged, not
> done here.**

### 5.1 Three zones — Hand · Active · Down

**RULE.** Every card is in one of three zones, and **facing encodes state, not secrecy**
(face-up = in play / available; face-down = spent / dormant):
- **Hand** — held; cards ready to play.
- **Active** — face-up on the table; everything in effect (Form, Lasting stances, charges).
- **Down** — face-down on the table; spent/dormant cards, recovered to Hand.
Each card declares a **start zone** (most start in Hand; Form and standing stances start Active; a
charge-up / cooldown card can start Down).

**WHY.** Cards-only (#7) forbids hidden timers; zones make each card's status a physical, public
fact. Three is the minimum that distinguishes *held* / *working* / *spent*.

**GUARANTEES.**
- No hidden state — a card's availability is always visible as its zone + facing.
- The core game is **open information**; facing is *state*, never concealment (hidden info is opt-in
  — the Clash card-pick, §1.0, and optional PvP commit-reveal).

### 5.2 Form vs Action — what you are vs what you do

**RULE.** Cards in Active split by behavior:
- **Form** — your fundamental card + attachments (your stats, §5.5). **Permanent: never Spends,
  immune to Disrupt** — it cannot be knocked Down. Stats may be *temporarily reduced* by **Lasting
  debuffs** in Active (Slow, Sunder, Confuse), but the Form card never leaves.
- **Action** — maneuvers, governed by the verbs (§5.3).
- **Abilities are Form cards.** A character's powers/attacks live on the **Form** as **passive, open
  enablers** — Active, **permanent (never Spend), immune to Disrupt**, and **never drawn** (no kit RNG,
  §0.1). Having an ability means you *may* use it **repeatably**, gated by **Tempo alone** (§4.4) —
  there is **no per-ability exhaustion**. The lone limiter is an explicit **one-shot**, which flips
  **face-down for the whole combat** (never resets). *(Power/Form timing — `cast` / `resolve` — is §4.6.)*

**WHY.** *Exhaustion touches what you do, never what you are* — so stats stay stable and
recomputable (§2.1) even as the action economy churns. "Form" is a card **property**, not a fourth
zone (it lives in Active).

**GUARANTEES.**
- A stat never exhausts; only a removable Lasting debuff can modify its value, and removing it
  restores the stat exactly (no maintained meter — §2.1).
- **Abilities are open, permanent, tempo-gated Form cards** — never drawn, never Spent/exhausted; a
  **one-shot** self-limits by flipping face-down for the combat (§4.4).

### 5.3 The verbs — default-return + Spend · Lasting · Recover · Disrupt

**RULE.** The **default** is: play a card, it **returns to Hand** (reusable next turn). Keywords
modify that:
- **Spend** — play → **Down** (a one-shot until Recovered).
- **Lasting** — play → **Active** (stays working until removed / Disrupted / consumed).
- **Recover** — move a card **Down → Hand** (the restore; costs a beat / Tempo).
- **Disrupt** — an attacker effect: move a target's **Active / Hand → Down** (force-exhaust).
Emergent: **cooldown** = Spend + a gated Recover; **combo** = a card that Recovers a specific card;
**engine** = a Lasting card that Recovers each Round; **disruption** = Disrupt.

**WHY.** A tiny verb set (#6) generates cooldowns / combos / engines with no bespoke per-card logic,
and each card's zone behavior prints as one line (#9/#10). The Clash kit (§1.0) is the simplest
case: four **default-return** cards ("no finite hand yet" = "everything is default-return").

**GUARANTEES.**
- Every card's lifecycle is {default | Spend | Lasting}, optionally acted on by {Recover | Disrupt};
  no other transitions exist.
- Adding cards never adds zone rules — new behavior composes existing verbs + tags (§5.4).

**MANUAL.** *Most cards return to your hand after use. A Spend card goes face-down until you Recover
it (Recover costs a beat). A Lasting card stays in play until removed. Disrupt knocks an enemy card
face-down.*

### 5.4 Tags — bounded cross-card interaction

**RULE.** Cards reference one another **by tag / type, never by name** (the damage types Fire /
Sharp / Blunt are the seed). A card's effect may **consume** tagged cards in Active by moving them
per the verbs. *(Worked example — fire charge-up: two `Charge(fire)` sit Lasting in Active; a Fire
card consumes them — damage ×2×2, Charges → Hand, Fire → Down. All zone-moves; the cost is the
setup Rounds.)*

**WHY.** Tags let cards combo while staying data-only and bounded — a name-reference is brittle and
unbounded; a small tag vocabulary is re-derivable (#6/#10).

**GUARANTEES.**
- Combos are {tag match} × {verb zone-move} — no bespoke combo code.
- Burst is paid for: charges cost the Rounds spent setting them up, not nothing.

### 5.5 Resources — Health · Tempo 🟡

**RULE.** Permanent **Form stats size a fluctuating pool** — you spend the pool, never the stats
(§3.1). There are **two** `count × value` pools in Active: **Health = Vitality × Toughness** (the value
gates damage) and **Tempo = Cadence × Finesse** (Cadence-many cards, each worth Finesse). *(Focus and Mind are
removed — merged 2026-06-20; defense is a Tempo spend.)* Spending moves cards to **Down**; they return
by **Recover** (or the round refresh). A **Tempo contest** compares the **total Finesse each side
commits** (§3); any other action just spends one card.
- **Round refresh** *(Tempo, at the Lull)* — the Tempo pool is **re-derived from the Form**
  (Cadence × Finesse) each Round — a per-Round budget, not cross-Round attrition. This is a *rebuild
  from the Form*, not a flip-back of only what was spent (§2.1).
- **Temporary Tempo is borrowed, not Form-backed** — a grant (e.g. **Haste**, §4 Salt) adds Tempo for
  the round as a **borrowed card** (from a shared supply), *not* one of your Form's Cadence cards. The
  re-derive rebuilds only from the Form, so borrowed Tempo does not return — it goes back to the supply
  at the Lull. Temporariness is therefore **emergent**: there is **no "does-not-refresh" marker**; only
  Form-Tempo persists, so a *lasting* Tempo gain must be a **Form change** (a Cadence stat card).
- **Heal cards** *(Health)* — Recover Health within a fight.
- **Refresh engines** — a Lasting card that Recovers Tempo mid-Round (how a god exceeds base breadth).
**Health is the one pool that persists within a fight** (the maintained meter, §2.1); everything
fully resets at the Day boundary.

**WHY.** One machinery governs actions *and* resources. In co-op PvE (instinct foes don't read you,
§7) the limiter is action-economy / attrition; the predictability-telegraph half of #8 bites in PvP
/ vs Characters. Master tunable: Recover/refresh rate vs Spend rate.

**GUARANTEES.**
- §2.1's "one maintained meter" holds — only Health persists; Tempo/Focus re-derive each Round.
- Pools are recomputable from cards on the table (count × value − spent).
- **Temporary Tempo is emergent, not flagged** — the Lull re-derives Tempo from the **Form**, so
  borrowed Tempo (e.g. Haste) vanishes with no "does-not-refresh" marker; a lasting Tempo gain requires
  a Form (Cadence) change. *(Engine: `refresh_round` sets `tempo = eff_cadence`, discarding borrowed Tempo.)*

*(SEEDED — **stats-as-deck** is now specced (§2.3 / §4.3). Until the `/spec-sync` code pass migrates
the schema, "Form stat" still resolves via the actor-card stat in the running code. Numbers — pool
sizes, Spend/Recover costs, charge magnitudes — live in `booklet.ron`, human-tuned.)*

**Open dials.** (1) **Attachment composition** — in the single-deck core, attachments **compose
commutatively**; the order-dependent **modifier** variant is part of the retired aspect/combo layer
(§6 → `retired-ideas.md`). (2) **`TERM` glossary vocabulary + encyclopedia + glossary test** —
land together in the **`/spec-sync §5`** code pass. (3) **Numbers** — `booklet.ron`.

### 5.6 Role-card taxonomy — Base · Modifier · Mode · Stat 🟡 *(in code 2026-06-19)*

**RULE.** A **role card** (§8.3) is exactly one of four kinds:
- **Base** — *played* from Hand; the track's core effect (normal §5.3 zone behaviour).
- **Modifier** — *passive*, lives in **Active** (§5.1); auto-applies to its Base (the scaling card),
  **never separately played** — so a base and its upgrade coexist under the §4.4 per-role cap.
- **Mode** — *played*; an alternative / charged Base (e.g. spend a round for a bigger effect),
  **mutually exclusive with the Base that round**. **[M1, 2026-06-19] Defined but deferred:** the
  first content (`role-card-redesign.md` §10) builds the L5 capstones as **`Spend`-zone Bases**
  instead — the existing §5.3 zone machine already gives the "big, once-per-fight" cooldown a Mode was
  meant to impose, with no new mechanic. The Mode kind stays in the taxonomy for the richer
  "spend-a-round-to-charge" tactical layer when playtest calls for it (→ `future-possibilities.md`).
- **Stat** — a **Form attachment** (§2.3 / §5.2): contributes to the stat block, **not played**.

**WHY.** The split lets richer high-level rewards (#5 power-up, §8.3) coexist with the **one-card-per-
role-per-round** cap (§4.4): Modifiers and Stats ride free; only **Base + Mode** plays count. It reuses
the existing **passive-power vs played-action** distinction (§5.2), so it is not new machinery.

**GUARANTEES.** A reward's cards are **self-contained** — its Modifiers / Stats apply *within* the set;
**no cross-reward multiplicative combo** (§0.1). *(Code/data + `TERM` lines land with the role-card
migration — `role-card-redesign.md` §8, Phase 2.)*

**Confirmed migration mechanics (2026-06-19).** The §10 first-draft content needs six small additions,
resolved at the §4.4/§5.6 spec-sync and pinned here so code follows spec:
- **M1 — Mode → `Spend` Base** (above): capstones are once-per-fight Spend Bases; the Mode kind is deferred.
- **M2 — `Guard`** (Wall L1 *Brace*): a played effect that adds **+Focus to the holder this round** — a
  defensive boost to the wall's block vs slips (§4.2 Focus). Seed +3.
- **M3 — "cannot fall" this round** (Wall L5 *Last Stand*): while active, damage that would down the
  holder leaves it at **1 health** instead — it cannot be downed for the round.
- **M4 — overwhelming burst** (Infiltrator L5 *Assassinate*): a high-Might Damage card that, on hitting
  an exposed enemy **Rearguard**, deals enough to empty its pool in one phase — it kills by Magnitude
  through the normal pile→pool path (§2.2), not a second kill-condition. (Reframed from the original
  "downs regardless of health" execute, which contradicted the §2.2 single kill-condition / Charter #13;
  the finisher identity is preserved via raw burst.)
- **M5 — `Curse` Modifier** (Controller L4): a passive that makes the owner's debuff cards
  (Slow / Confuse / Stagger) each hit **+1 additional foe** — the one instance of the Modifier mechanic
  in the draft (lean-new-effect dial, §9.1).
- **M6 — `targets: all`** (Support L5 *Sanctuary*): a buff effect (Mend / Brace / Haste) may target
  **all allies** — a party-wide target mode.

## 6. Aspects / the chord — *retired*

**Retired to `retired-ideas.md` (decommissioned 2026-06-21).** The multi-deck **chord/combo** system
(a character as a set of aspect-decks; a play as one card per aspect, combined) was **dropped**: the
single-deck core — Form (fundamental + attachments) + Action cards over the §5 zones — plus the §4.4
role-card play deliver its intent, and a fused-action chord works against Charter #2 (small,
computable tactics). `retired-ideas.md` records the full rationale and **the bar it must clear to
return**. *(Section kept as a stable §6 anchor; the heading is referenced elsewhere.)*

*(Terminology note: the single **defense channel** (§2) is unaffected — it is a damage track, not the
retired deck-chord, despite the shared word "aspect.")*

## 7. Agents — Character vs Creature ⬜

*Stub.* The line is **theory of mind**: a Character reasons and predicts you back
(two-way); a Creature draws from a behavior deck (its instinct = its decision,
one-way), reshuffles, never exhausts. Source:
[`notes/entities.md`](../notes/entities.md),
[`notes/decision-making.md`](../notes/decision-making.md).

## 8. Strategic layer — *the run* 🟡

The game outside a single fight: the world map, the clock, **role-card rewards**, encounters, and
progression. Full design background: `progression-design.md` and **`role-card-redesign.md`** (the
reward model now governing §8.3 / §8.5, with §4.4 / §5.6); `reference-scenario.md` is the balance
harness. **Run-level victory is provisional** (a test goal — §8.2); **run-level defeat is deliberately
undefined** — deferred until the mechanics are tested against the reference scenario, so difficulty is
tuned from data, not guessed. Numbers throughout are `booklet.ron`, human-tuned. The **role-card
redesign is now in code** (2026-06-19): no currency / Upgrades — clearing `(track, level)` unlocks an
atomic reward assigned at unlock; combat enforces the §4.4 cap + positional gating; the 25 sets live in
`booklet.ron` (see `role-card-redesign.md` §8–§10). One migration remains pending: **stats-as-deck**
(§2.3 / §4.3 / §5.5).

### 8.1 The world — locations, movement, fog

**RULE.** The world is **face-down location cards** in a scenario-authored layout — a **grid**, an
**offset-hex** field (alternate rows shifted half a card), or a mix. A character's **identity card**
(its Actor) marks where it is. Entering a location **flips it face-up** (revealing its name → its
**Suit** (§8.5) → the **threat deck** it draws from, §8.4) but does **not** start a fight.
Movement is **one adjacent space per Day** (§8.2). *(Travel cost / risk beyond this is deferred.)*

**The grind base — 25 location cards.** The §8.3 reward set is the world's **experience-grind base**:
**one location card per `(Suit, level)`** — five Suits × five levels = **25 cards**, each a single-tier
clear that grants its Suit's rewards `1..=level` (a higher card **subsumes** the lower ones, so they
are skippable — difficulty + travel cost are what discourage leaping ahead). The base set tiles a
**5×5 grid**, placed by a **seed** the world is created with (so a layout is reproducible and a
reference/test scenario is predictable — the seed is a world-creation parameter alongside the combat
seed; the full grid is always connected, so every card is reachable for any seed). A game uses **some
subset of the 25** (usually all) plus **scenario-specific special locations** whose treasures sit
*outside* the 25-card base and change play more dramatically.

**WHY.** Cards-only (#7); a face-down map makes scouting a push-your-luck act (#2) and is the engine
of doom-to-mastery (#5 — you learn a place by going there); a pawn on a map is a clean metaphor (#9).

**GUARANTEES.**
- Entering reveals information only; combat is always opt-in (§8.4).
- Position is a single card on the table — no hidden coordinates.

### 8.2 The clock & the run goal

**RULE.** Time advances in **Days**, driven by the **event deck** (for now only *"1 day passes"*
cards — a placeholder for real world events). Each Day, **every character** may **move one space**,
use a **per-day ability** *(deferred)*, and attempt **one Encounter** (§8.4); all act **in parallel**
(order-independent; no turn order, §1.9 / §3.1). At the **Day boundary** everything **fully resets**
(Health, all pools, Action cards Recover; §5.5). **Run victory (provisional):** clear the scenario's
**objective / final location**; the run is **scored in Days** (golf par — fewer is better). **Run
defeat: undefined** — deferred until tested against the reference scenario.

**WHY.** A single scalar (Days-to-clear) is the balance instrument — it stresses routing, encounter
difficulty, the economy, and the depth/breadth fork at once (#2 strategy; balance-by-scenario #4).
Deferring defeat until we *measure* avoids guessing difficulty before we have data.

**GUARANTEES.**
- The only thing a run spends (for now) is **Days**; nothing yet kills a party (full daily reset →
  no cross-Day attrition).
- No turn order at the strategic layer — characters act in parallel within a Day.

### 8.3 Rewards & role cards 🟡 *(in code 2026-06-19)*

**RULE.** Clearing **level X of a Suit-track Y** unlocks the **reward** for `(Y, X)` — a reward **of
that Suit** (§8.5): a fixed, **atomic set** of cards — role-effect card(s), a bundled generic **Stat**
card, and any passive **Modifier** (§5.6) — **one physical copy each** (scarce). The **party assigns
the whole set, permanently, to one character — at unlock** (the clear that earns it surfaces the
choice; there is no holding pool). Five Suits × five levels = **25 rewards**. **No currency** — clearing
*is* the unlock (clear level N of a Suit ⇒ its levels 1..N). Each card prints its `(suit, level)`
**provenance** (e.g. *Iron · III*), so a set is identifiable by its Suit and stays together.

> **Replaced (2026-06-19) — the currency economy.** §8.3 was *Currency & loot*: clearing earned typed
> **Currency** (Iron/Silver/Brass/Bone/Salt + generic Gold) that bought stat **Upgrades**, balance
> recomputed `earned − spent`. The redesign drops the currency *middleman* — clearing unlocks a
> role-card reward **directly** (the depth/breadth fork lives in routing). The five currencies survive
> only as **track colours/identities**; generic **Gold** becomes the bundled **Stat layer**, not a
> currency. (The *co-location* spend rule was already cut as bookkeeping.) Full design + migration plan:
> [`role-card-redesign.md`](../../role-card-redesign.md).
>
> **Renamed (2026-06-20) — "track colour/identity" → Suit.** Those five surviving identities are now the
> first-class **Suits** (§8.5): **Iron · Silver · Brass · Bone · Salt**, bound 1:1 to the five Roles.
> Treasure is named by its **Suit**, not its Role. **Gold is retired** (no sixth/generic suit — the
> Stat layer is suit-less). Pure vocabulary; no mechanic or number changed.

**WHY.** One-copy scarcity (no stacking) + atomic permanent assignment make *"who carries this"* a
weighty choice (#2 opportunity cost; #4 team balance); the shared pool is a **party-size-independent
power budget** (#4: god ≈ party-total). Direct unlock keeps the build a §0.1 *no-path-dependent-budget*
function of clears + assignment, with the strategic fork in **routing** (§8.1–8.2).

**GUARANTEES.**
- Total reward power = a function of **levels cleared**, shared and distributed — party-size-independent.
- A reward is **atomic** — acquired and assigned as one unit, never sub-drafted or split — so the
  build-space dimension is the **count of rewards, not cards** (§0.1).
- **No path-dependent budget** (§0.1): the build is *which rewards are owned and who holds each*;
  assignment is **permanent** (no sell-back, no oscillation).
- **Power is monotone in level** — within a track a deeper reward is *at least as powerful* as a
  shallower one (the doom-to-mastery curve, #5); complexity is an *optional lever* for that power,
  never the intent.
- One physical copy per reward; each card prints its `(suit, level)` provenance, so scarcity and
  atomic assignment are legible / self-enforcing.

### 8.4 Encounters — the parametric deck-recipe

**RULE.** Combat at a location is **opt-in at a chosen level**. Every location has a **Suit** (§8.5),
its threat's identity. On first engagement a single **encounter card** is drawn from that **Suit's
threat deck** (one deck **per Suit** — five) and then **fixed**: it is the location's **persistent,
learnable threat** (retrying faces the
*same* fight). The encounter card is a **parametric deck-recipe** evaluated at the attempted level —
a roster and **thematic** stat-scaling (which stats scale signals the counter to bring). The **level
is one dial scaling reward and threat together**.

**WHY.** Each threat deck is a **diegetic tutorial** — you meet a **Suit's** threats and unlock that
**Suit's role cards** that answer them (#1 reward intellect; #6 emergence). A fixed, learnable threat
means failure teaches (#1); one dial keeps the risk/reward choice honest and re-derivable (#2 / #10).

**GUARANTEES.**
- Reveal gives the **Suit** (threat deck), never the exact card before you commit a fight.
- A failed clear costs a Day and the threat persists; you advance only by beating it at the depth
  you want.

### 8.5 Progression & roles 🟡 *(in code 2026-06-19)*

**RULE.** A character **is its assigned role cards** — "role" is *emergent*, not a label, and roles
only **accrete** (assignment is permanent, §8.3). There are five **role tracks**, the §4 triangle's
**`3 + 2`**. Each track has two names in **different registers**:
- a **Suit** — its **identity**, a substance: **Iron · Silver · Brass · Bone · Salt**;
- a **Role** — its **function** in combat: **Wall · Infiltrator · Artillery · Controller · Support**.

They are bound **1:1** — **Iron = Wall · Silver = Infiltrator · Brass = Artillery · Bone = Controller ·
Salt = Support**. The **Suit is what a reward / treasure *is*; the Role is what it *does*.** Name a
treasure by its **Suit** — *"an Iron reward,"* never *"a Wall reward"* — so identity never collapses
into function. (Identity and function are deliberately kept in different registers — substance vs.
combat job — so the Suit never merely restates the Role.) A generic **Stat layer** is **bundled into
every reward** and is **suit-less** (the retired generic, **Gold**, is gone — now a stat-card pairing,
not a sixth Suit). A character's **first clear commits a direction**; from there it **specializes**
(depth: pour one track) or **branches** (breadth: cover several). Party size sets the spectrum: many
bodies → specialists (one track each); few → multi-track; one → a **god** spanning all five.

**WHY.** Characters are deliberately unbalanced; coverage and challenge come from the **team and the
scenario** (#4). Depth-vs-breadth is the uncomputable strategic fork (#2), fractally at map and build
scale; the party-size spectrum **is** the god ≈ party-total balance budget (#4). Role-as-assigned-cards
makes "god ≈ party" *concrete* — the **same** shared pool, distributed — and **tempo-gated** role-card
play (§4.4) is what equalizes their throughput (conserved Tempo, not a fiat cap). **A reward needs a noun of its own:** named only by its Role,
*"a Wall treasure"* conflates what it *is* with what it *does* — the **Suit** gives identity its own
register (#10 conceptual integrity — each concept named once, for one job).

**Why exactly five — `3 + 2`.** The role set is the *smallest complete* one on both of combat's axes,
so the count is re-derivable, not arbitrary (#10):
- **Three damage roles = the §4 *playstyle* triangle's vertices, one per declared intention:** **Wall =
  Turtle = Vanguard** (hold / block the front), **Infiltrator = Aggressor = Outrider** (the declared flank
  that raids the exposed back), **Artillery = Glass-Cannon = Rearguard** (fire from safety). Three is the
  *minimal* counter-cycle — the `Aggressor ▸ Glass-Cannon ▸ Turtle ▸ Aggressor` RPS needs exactly three.
  (One role per **declared intention** now — the Outrider is its own position, §4, not a Vanguard
  sub-type.)
- **Two effect roles = the complete duality of state-bending:** **Support** *augments* your side (`+`:
  heal / brace / haste), **Controller** *degrades* theirs (`−`: slow / confuse / weaken). Two is the
  whole of that duality.

So **5 = a complete engagement cycle (3) + a complete effect pair (2).** **Four** would break one —
drop a vertex and the triangle is no longer a counter-cycle, or drop an effect and the `+/−` pair is
lopsided. **Six** would need a new orthogonal axis (there isn't an obvious one beyond *where you fight*
and *how you bend state*) or an over-granular *split* of an existing role (refinement, not a new role —
against #6 / the small core).

**GUARANTEES.**
- The five roles are **`3 + 2`**: the §4 playstyle triangle's three vertices (Turtle / Aggressor /
  Glass-Cannon = Wall / Infiltrator / Artillery — one per declared intention: Vanguard / Outrider /
  Rearguard) plus the two effect directions (augment = Support, degrade = Controller) — *minimal-complete on
  both axes*, not an arbitrary list.
- A character's roles = its assigned role-card tracks; they **accrete** (monotone, §0.1).
- **Stats are bundled with role rewards** — the survivability to *use* a role grows *with* the role;
  there is no free-floating generic stat pool (no "stat-mule").
- Five role tracks (the `3 + 2`); the generic is a **Stat layer**, not a sixth track.
- **Each track has exactly one Suit** — a 1:1 Suit↔Role binding. There are **exactly five Suits**
  (Iron · Silver · Brass · Bone · Salt) and **no generic / colourless suit**; the bundled Stat layer is
  **suit-less**.
- A solo god ≈ a full party in total power (the budget difficulty is tuned against).

**Glossary.** *(Encyclopedia terms — generated from these `TERM` lines into the in-app reference.)*

- **TERM.** `Suit` (Roles) — A role track's **identity** (a substance): Iron · Silver · Brass · Bone · Salt, bound 1:1 to a **Role** (Wall · Infiltrator · Artillery · Controller · Support). The Suit is what a reward *is*; the Role is what it *does*. Name treasure by its Suit — "an Iron reward," never "a Wall reward."

*(SEEDED — §8 is the strategic layer's first graduation. The **role-card redesign** (this §8.3 / §8.5
plus §4.4 / §5.6) is now **in code** (2026-06-19): no currency/Upgrades; clearing unlocks an atomic
reward assigned at unlock; combat enforces the §4.4 cap + positional gating; the 25 sets are authored in
`booklet.ron` (Phases 1–4 of [`role-card-redesign.md`](../../role-card-redesign.md) §8). The
**stats-as-deck** power mechanism (§2.3 / §4.3 / §5.5) is still a pending `/spec-sync`. **Travel risk**,
**per-day abilities**, **world events**, and **run-level defeat** are deferred (the last until
reference-scenario testing). Numbers are `booklet.ron`, human-tuned. `TERM` glossary lines + encyclopedia
land with the `/spec-sync §8` code pass.)*

### 8.6 The role set is necessary-and-sufficient 🟡

**RULE.** The five Roles (`3 + 2`, §8.5) are **necessary and sufficient** for the campaign, measured on
the reference scenarios under the analysis envelope (§0.4):
- **Sufficient.** A party whose **collective coverage includes all five Roles** can clear the reference
  campaign under optimal play.
- **Necessary (each Role load-bearing).** For **each** Role R, a party identical except that **R's
  coverage is removed** **fails at least one** reference scenario — the scenario that is R's *lock*.
- **Distinct.** Each Role has a **signature mechanic** (Wall: the hold / Phalanx; Infiltrator: slip /
  Blitz; Artillery: ranged fire; Controller: round-scoped status; Support: buff / heal) that is
  **invoked and outcome-changing** in at least one reference scenario; no two Roles clear their lock by
  the same mechanic.

The invariant is **campaign-scope**: an **individual** conflict may be winnable by one Role alone, or
unwinnable for the Role it is built to humble — a single-Role spotlight is a **tutorial** (§8.4) in that
Role's powers and limits, **not** a violation.

**WHY.** §8.5 establishes the role set is minimal-complete *by counting* (a triangle + an effect pair).
§8.6 makes that completeness a **measured property of play** (Charter #11, #12): "uniquely valuable"
becomes *demonstrably the only key to some lock*, "behave differently" becomes *demonstrably a different
mechanic*, and the stat layer gets its acceptance test — a stat earns its slot **iff** it lies on some
Role's load-bearing path (Charter #12: *stats serve the Roles*). Without a measure, role-necessity is a
slogan; the leave-one-out check turns it into a regression test.

**GUARANTEES.**
- The reference campaign has, for each Role, a **designated lock scenario** unwinnable without that Role,
  wired as a **regression test** (#11: the par solver is a regression test). Losing necessity for any
  Role **fails the build**.
- **Damage belongs to the triangle.** Only the three §4-triangle Roles — **Wall, Infiltrator,
  Artillery** — deal **direct damage**. The two effect Roles never do: **Controller** *degrades*
  (round-scoped status or stat-drop, no damage — §2.2 control is stat-drop, not damage) and **Support** *augments* (buff / heal,
  no damage). A Controller or Support card that dealt direct damage would collapse the 3+2 distinction
  (**Charter #13**). *(Locked 2026-06-21.)*
- **Necessity is emergent, not by fiat.** A lock scenario makes its Role necessary through the foe's
  **stats and behaviour** (an offense you must *disable*, an armor you must *pierce*, a backfield you
  must *reach*) — **never** through an **immunity** or keyword that *bans* the other Roles. Emergence
  test: with R removed, the others are **outpaced within the analysis envelope** (§0.4), not
  **forbidden** by a rule. An immunity gate that manufactures necessity is a **defect** — it satisfies
  the necessity check while violating Charter #12 / #6. *(Systemic channel cross-immunity, §2.2, is not a
  fiat gate — it is a symmetric system, not a per-foe script.)*
- **No redundant stat:** every stat the engine carries is **read** on some Role's resolution path; a stat
  the engine never consumes is a **failing** state, not a latent one.
- The invariant is **campaign-scope** (some scenario per Role), never per-encounter; single-Role
  tutorials are intended, not breaches.
- Measured on the **core** (§0.1) under the **analysis envelope** (§0.4); like all balance claims it is
  **policy-relative** to the resolver-of-record (§0.3) and **blind to fun / feel** (the human ratifies
  those).

*(SEEDED — a designer/solver invariant graduating Charter #12; **no `TERM` line** (not player
vocabulary). The enforcing tests — sufficiency, leave-one-out necessity, no-redundant-stat, distinctness
— ride the par-solver / balance harness (§0.3, `computability-and-balance.md`); the cheap "is every stat
consumed?" check can land **ahead of** the solver. The five **designated lock scenarios** — one per Role,
doubling as the role tutorials — are an authoring task on the reference set (§8.4).)*
